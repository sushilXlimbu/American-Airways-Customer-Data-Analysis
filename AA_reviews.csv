0,"Not Verified |  With Newark Airport experiencing so many problems right now, I asked AA to change a flight for my 88 year old mother who will be flying this weekend. I asked for them to change her to a flight traveling to Lehigh Valley vs. Newark to forego any unforeseen problems. Due to her flight being a basic economy, I was told no. I asked to speak to a manager, was given one, then told managers above that level don't accept phone calls. The absolute unwillingness to help an 88 year old woman, and the complete lack of customer service has turned me off to AA forever. We will never fly this airline again."
1,"Not Verified |  Absolutely unacceptable experience with American Airlines. Our Friday evening flight was delayed from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM, pushing our arrival to 1:30 AM—well past our car rental pickup window. Since my wife had plans to stay with her aunt, we accepted American’s offer to reschedule for a 9:00 AM flight the next morning. We rearranged our entire trip—appointments, schedules, everything—around that new plan. Then, without warning, the morning flight was delayed again… to 5:00 PM. At that point, the entire purpose of our trip was ruined. We had to cancel everything, and now there’s absolutely no reason to even go. American Airlines completely derailed our plans, wasted our time, and left us with zero confidence in their ability to manage or communicate effectively. This was our last time flying with you. Never again."
2,"Not Verified |  First delay happened in Arkansas. Was delayed by about an hour. Got to DFW late for connecting flight. That got delayed and then canceled, rebooted delayed canceled, rebooted, delayed canceled, rebooted again and still wound up having to stay in DFW for over 12 HOURS. Got told that they don't do refunds, which is actually against their own published policy. Basically, a 5 and a half hour total time flight turned into a 17 +/- hour long flight. While I was left stranded at DFW, I witnessed several other flights being canceled for various reasons."
3,"✅ Trip Verified |   I was desperate to get to Arizona in 2023 to help my son who was experiencing a very serious health crisis and was in an extremely dangerous situation. The agents basically shut the doors in my face and were not helpful, kind or understanding. The situation required me to get on the most immediate flight on any airline that would get me there as soon as possible. Eventually, I was given a flight credit but American Airline did not explain the short nature of the credit and never sent a courtesy email or anything. Now I find out they have erased my credit. I don't expect the airline to care enough about me to do anything so flying American would bring up many bad feelings and memories."
4,"✅ Trip Verified |   Travelling first class on a domestic flight within America is typically not something to write home about. That is – unless you’re flying with American Airlines from LAX to JFK. If so, make sure to fly on their direct flight with an Airbus A321 aircraft that was specifically designed and configured for these transcontinental flights. In fact, it has it’s on aircraft type – an A321T (the T stands for Transcontinental). First Class is a separate cabin at the font of the aircraft. Here you’ll find 10 individual first-class open suite - 5 rows with one on either side so each has windows and direct aisle access. This was quite a surprise for a single aisle narrow body jet. There was one dedicated flight attendant for all 10 passengers so kept pretty busy for the entire flight. He was bright and attentive. The breakfast meal was a pretty average affair but my expectations were low based on the airline’s reputation. The seat converts to a full lay-flat bed and was very comfortable and with fluffy pillows and blanket. I fell asleep easily and slept well for a few hours and woke to the smell of cookies being freshly baked in the forward galley. This was a nice touch and something the flight attendant clearly enjoyed doing. The wait for the luggage to arrive at the belt was particularly long and stressful when you are getting constant phone calls from your driver to check if it’s arrived."
5,Not Verified |   Do not travel on American Airlines unless you have no other choice which was and is my case. This review refers only to American Airlines telephone customer service; before my return trip next week I needed to ask AA something concern my flight. The local number that I had is disconnected and no new number provided. Consequently I had to make a long distance overseas call for which I was billed long distance telephone charges that lasted almost fifteen minutes before the AA representative was able to give a local number which was not disconnected.
6,"✅ Trip Verified |   I knew there was something wrong with the entertainment system before we left LAX because I had watched the huddle of technicians from my seat. They had removed the cover off a rather large panel and were pushing buttons and muttering. My suspicions were confirmed when there was no safety video and they did it the old fashioned way with the crew standing in the aisle with an oxygen mask in one hand and a life vest around their necks. However, they didn’t say a word about it to the passengers until we were in the air and well on our way to Sydney. I guess they figured the reaction of learning you faced 15 hours without movies, music or games would be less in the air than on the ground. Well, at least I could enjoy the leisurely pace of the first class meal service; so I thought. But clearly the 2 male flight attendants looking after the first class cabin had better things to do. The service was practically over before it began. The courses came so fast I could barely keep up and the food was terrible. All in all it was one of the worst flights I’ve had in years and the 2 guys looking after first class should retire and pass the mantle to someone less jaded."
7,"✅ Trip Verified |   Had a great flight in from Tampa on our way to 5 national parks in Utah. Chance and Erico were fantastic, spectacular service and took great care of us."
8,"Not Verified |  My daughter and I were traveling from Norfolk VA to Boston MA on April 8, 2025. We had a flight that was suppose to depart at 8:06AM leaving from Norfolk with a connection in Philadelphia then on to Boston arriving around 10:30-11am. We were at the Norfolk airport at 7am waiting for our flight to board when the 1st delay was announced for 2 hours. We went up to the ticket counter and the agent was able to rebook us on a different connecting flight only delaying us about 2 hours. The second delay of 6 hours was announced about an hour before the second boarding was suppose to happen. And the announcement was to call American customer service to rebook again. I did call customer service and was rebooked on a different flight going to Laguardia airport and we had to wait 3 hours for this flight to depart. This short flight on a smaller plane was extremely turbulent on the last half and my daughter and I were so nauseated and exhausted. The layover in Laguardia was another 2-3 hours. At least Laguardia had a nice food court and we were able to sit and have lunch. The flight to Boston was uneventful.  I am very disappointed in the delays and handling of passengers by American Airlines. This delay should have been called much earlier. They announced it was due to mechanical issues. Why not inspect the planes more frequently and cancel flights at least 6-8 hours before the flight departs if any issues. That way passengers can be rebooked and notified ahead of time. And if this does happen last minute airlines should be required to offer cash or gift card or something. It was a horrible experience and day and one I will never forget. I plan on never flying with American again. And I will be letting my friends and family know what a bad experience this was so that this does not happen to them. I was not the only angry and disappointed passenger. I overheard other passengers stating this happens alot with American airlines,"
9,✅ Trip Verified |   I have flown five flights with American Airlines in the last 4 months. Each one has been delayed over 5 hours for mechanical problems. When you contact American Airlines they don't care they just blow you off. They don't care that they're delaying you missing appointments and connections.
10,"✅ Trip Verified |   My flight was originally for 6:15 am, this flight was delayed. I was issued a new ticket that required me to be stranded in Phoenix Arizona for 11 hours. I was originally supposed to arrive at my destination (Minneapolis) at 2:14 pm. My 6 hour trip turned into an all day event. Also, I just got word that my flight to Phoenix is, once again, delayed. I spent a lot of money for this trip... this may as well be a greyhound station."
11,"✅ Trip Verified |   My recent flight from Washington, D.C. (DCA) to Philadelphia (PHL) with American Eagle, operated by PSA Airlines, was smooth and efficient. We experienced a minor maintenance delay, but on a 27-minute flight, it hardly made a difference. The crew was pleasant and professional, ensuring a comfortable experience. The aircraft, a CRJ-900, is the largest in PSA’s fleet, offering a bit more space compared to their other planes. Given the short duration of the flight, there’s really nothing to complain about it was a quick, easy, and well-handled trip. Great job PSA!"
12,"✅ Trip Verified |   My Husband and I traveled on American Airlines Flight AA3089 to New York from Florida. We were extremely pleased traveling home on this plane. This was mainly due to Flight Attendant DeJon. DeJon made sure we were comfortable, asked us what drinks we wanted, and served us snacks and a very nice lunch. Mostly, he was so congenial and I could see he was working so hard taking care of the passengers. My Husband and I are seniors and I can honestly say that we very much appreciated DeJon. It made our flight enjoyable, and we were glad we flew with American Airlines."
13,"Not Verified | I had two flights booked between St. Louis and Chicago to meet up with friends for a vacation flight out of Chicago. There was impending weather, snow. I changed my flight on February 12 in the evening to 3:10 in the afternoon in order to get to Chicago in time for the next morning flight. I had to pay an additional $188 to change the flight. The flight was cancelled by the airline and I ended up on the same flight I was originally booked on! That flight was delayed but I did get to Chicago late Wednesday night. They refused to reimburse me for the extra amount paid for the cancelled flight! I should not have had to pay that fee when they cancelled the flight! On the way back to St. Louis there was potential weather. However, our flight from Mexico got into O'Hare with no problem. But my flight from Chicago to St. Louis had been delayed earlier that morning and there were no flights out of O'Hare (according the the RUDE American Airlines person) so I had to either sit in the airport for 13 hours or pay for a room - they refused to get me a room! They claimed weather as an excuse but there was no weather they had just tried to out-guess it and got it wrong. So I had to pay for a room, my bag again the next day because it couldn't be transferred, an extra day of parking and an extra day of care for my pet - $309! No customer service. Their supervisor was also uncaring and rude. I ended up falling on an escalator trying to get my bags around by myself due to them!!"
14,"Not Verified | Overnight flight was delayed twice for not enough crew and then no crew. Still no guarantee it will take off. Had to buy blankets, $60, and kids sleeping on the disgustingly dirty floor. Trying to get to a family member before they pass. How can you stay in business with this poor customer service? Your company needs a major overhaul. Someone has to be held accountable. "
15,"✅ Trip Verified |   Horrible experience. The online check-in didn’t work and the airport check-in experience was super complicated and took 1.5h so we almost missed our flight. My partner & I were assigned separate seats even though we were on the same booking. The agents there were very accommodating and were doing their best given the system restrictions. Apparently, the system didn’t recognize that we were only transiting in India and needed us to submit a visa for India which is not needed for transit. The agents specifically told us that it’s good that we didn’t bring checked luggage because we cannot leave the transit area. The agents at the gate forced us to give up the luggage under the premise that we would receive them directly when we exit the plane. There was lots of space on the plane to put carry-on luggage. Upon arrival, of course, our luggage was not there and the New Delhi staff told us we needed to pick up the luggage at the belt. So now, we can‘t receive the luggage and have been stuck at the airport for 2h at this point and missed our connecting flight while they‘re trying to figure out the situation. Also, our initial AA flight was 2h delayed as well. No food vouchers or any other compensation offered. Better communication and coordination among their teams would be appreciated for an airline that calls itself American Airlines."
16,"✅ Trip Verified |   My wife and I had a 1-stop flight from DFW to St Thomas, with a connecting flight out of Miami. Both flights, DFW to Miami and Miami to St Thomas were through American Airlines. Out flight from DFW to Miami was delayed by 2 hours due to mechanical failure, and all passengers were put on a different plane. The new flight landed in Miami 10 minutes before our connecting flight (Miami to St Thomas) took off, but American couldn't delay their flight 5 minutes to allow 9 passengers to make the last connecting flight out of St Thomas. So basically, we were stuck in Miami for the night and were booked on the first flight (8:30 am) the next morning. We were offered a hotel voucher at a cheap airport hotel; which was a far cry from the beach front resort that we had purchased (priced by the hotel at $620/night). My wife and I also had checked the bags with all of our clothes, so we didn't have a change of clothes until we reached our destination (St Thomas). On the next day we reached arrived at our gate early, but were told that our flight had been delayed due to weather and that we would be flying out 7 hours later. We later found out that this was a lie, and that really the cause for delay was that an emergency landing had been made on St Thomas' only landing strip, and that an hour and a half cleanup of the landing strip was required. All other airlines resumed flights within 2 hours. So, we spent another 7 hours in the airport waiting for our flight. All-in we spent 24 hours stuck in Miami without a change of clothes, most of it spent in the airport, when a 5-miute delay of one flight (that was on time) could have solved their own failure entirely. American Airlines' first attempt at compensation was to offer my wife and I 2500 aa points each. If you figure those points are worth about $0.01, then the total value of their compensation was $50 = 2 x 0.01 x 2500. After writing them an email explaining that I am prepared to take them to small claims court, they offered me and my wife each $100 travel vouchers. After I denied again, they offered us each $150 travel vouchers. After I denied again, they apologized but said there was no other offer. I also asked how much money American made on the sale of our seats, and they said the representative said he didn't know. Basically, American Airlines believes they are entitled to screw you over and doesn't care to compensate you for damages whatsoever. Not only that, everyone of their agents (rebooking/gate) are entitled and have a terrible attitude. Personally, I have no desire to fly with them again as any trust in this company's capacity to conduct honest business has been eviscerated."
17,"Not Verified |  American airlines is the only carrier that supports flights into Yuma, AZ, and with my employer always booking work trips with them, and my family needing to use them out of Yuma, we unfortunately fly with them everytime. There is an issue with delays, maintenance, forced rebooking, sitting on the taxiway both prior to takeoff and after, at least 80% of the time. It is not an exaggeration. It's mind blowing how they are never held accountable for terrible service and especially at the prices they charge. Too many times I've found myself in a dead sprint in the airport (Phoenix, Charlotte, Dallas, Philidelphia) trying to make my gate because of this poorly run business."
18,"✅ Trip Verified |   Seat Comfort was excellent. Legroom was excellent. The hard product is very good. The soft product is abysmal and food is unacceptable. Communication is poor. The staff is truly detached from their customers. Not just the flight attendants, but the gate agents and counter personnel. It seems like they don’t want to be at their job jobs. So detached that when we landed in Madrid, the purser welcomed us to Paris, France. I almost always fly British Airways. This time a segment was on American. Never again."
19,"✅ Trip Verified |   Terrible experience. First flight was delayed, forcing me to not walk but sprint to my connection which was on the total opposite side of the airport. And when I arrived at the ticket scanning desk, was met with an extremely rude attendant who gave me quite the attitude when she clearly saw that I was huffing and puffing in order to make this connection. She made me check my small suitcase at the gate because it “wasn’t gonna fit” in overhead storage. Meanwhile there was plenty of overhead space upon entering plane. This is important to remember for later. The second flight was fine, but after landing, made my way over to baggage claim after being met with, again, a very rude and dismissive agent who informed me that they put my suitcase with all the other large checked bags. Well, now I have been waiting at baggage claim 9 at JFK for over an hour with no sight of any suitcases. Not mine, not anyone’s! And quite honestly this is not what I needed after an exhausting work trip on a Saturday evening. I have serious beef with you American Airlines and will not be using you ever again."
20,"✅ Trip Verified |   Another horrible experience with AA. First you oversold the flight (again), which caused my wife and I to be the last two ticketed passengers for the flight despite the fact I purchased the tickets over 3 months prior and attempted to check in early. And while we barely made the flight, it caused a significant amount of stress to ourselves and our traveling party since we were the trip leaders of our group. Then you made us check our carry on baggage (which had become a common problem with AA for us), which caused additional problems at our layover since my wife had put her passport in her carry on. And when we finally were able to board, we discovered that there was plenty of room for more carry ons (one overhead bin was completely empty, plus other spaces). On our return flight, we were again required to check our carry on baggage and upon boarding found there was, again, plenty of remain space for bags. This made us run tight for our layover coming back to the US and required us to wait FORTY-FIVE MINUTES for our ""carry on"" baggage at our final destination, which was almost a midnight arrival already ( thanks to a 1 hr delay). As icing on the cake, the flight attendants from PUJ to ORD were quite testy with passengers and even each other. Overall, what a fun story to tell my friends. You guys need to change some policies."
21,"✅ Trip Verified |   My husband developed a high fever mid-flight, and despite informing the crew, not a single member offered assistance. No temperature check, no hydration, not even basic concern. I was left to tend to him, using a cold towel on his head while the crew ignored us.  When I approached them again a crew member rolled their eyes, made a face, and sarcastically muttered, “Oh, perfect. What do you need now?”. A high fever in a pressurized cabin is a serious concern, yet they acted as if we were nothing but a burden. They handed out meals with no regard for meal preferences and both times, I ended up with nothing because they ran out of choices.  I repeatedly asked for hot water for my husband. One crew member said, “I don’t have it on the cart.” Another promised to bring it but never came back. Yet this same crew member walked past my seat multiple times, ignoring me. The crew on this flight were rude, dismissive, and downright incompetent.  This was, the most emotionally draining, physically exhausting 14 hours of my life. "
22,"Not Verified |  I wanted to make a review for American Airlines flight crew member Kimo. He was our flight attendant from Fayetteville Regional Airport while on our way to Hawaii.  He was exceptionally lovely, fun, and caring! This tiny plane flight went from Fayettville to Charlotte, and even with the flight being so short, he gave us water. I am pregnant and he was extra caring for me to give me water and pretzels to help with the nausea. Thank you Kimo for being such a great part of my flight experience!"
23,"Not Verified |  Flew out of Albany Flight 440 2/13/25. Customer service atrocious. Check in was nice that’s all, but boarding attendants and flight attendants were the rudest people I’ve ever encountered. Not family oriented. Seems like they tried to make my trip harder with a toddler. Everything seemed like a bother. Asking us if we wanted a drink or snack annoyed them. Literally if you dislike people and want to ruin someone’s day apply to American Airlines. "
24,"Not Verified | I paid for an exit row seat in Premium Economy for the DFW to Seattle leg. The flight was missed due to mechanical issues. The surly gate agent issuing my ticket for a later flight informed me that although I was not in an exit row seat or Premium Economy, the price difference would be refunded. She lied. This never happened and when contacting customer service I was denied a refund. This is not the first time I’ve had issues with this paltry excuse for an airline. Delayed flights are standard as is a subpar onboard experience, including their onboard entertainment never working. In short, I will avoid flying them if there are any other airline options and would encourage others to do the same."
25,"Very pleasent experience. Charlotte airport easy to manage, easy check in and fast security line. Admirals Club available but not as good as the premiere lounges in NYC and MIA. Boarding on time, by groups. Once on board, crew nice but nothing special, seat very comfortable for PE, nice amenity kit. Service ok, hot towel to start with, then drinks and dinner. All in nice served and well managed by crew. IFE very good selection. Manage +4 hrs of sleep on a 7hr flight, so really good. Did not have breakfast since I was sleeping, no comment on that. Recommend this airline."
26,"Not Verified |  The seating was ridiculous. My husband's knees we against the seat in front of him for the entire flight. The plane was late, then we sat on the runway in Miami for 2 hours waiting to taxi. The ac didn't function properly. Heat was blowing out for 1 hr of the flight ... when it is 80 degrees outside. The flight attendants were very helpful during a medical issue, which was truly a blessing. Everything else was horrendous."
27,"Not Verified |  Should have read the reviews before we booked. Gate changed 2 times and delayed 4 times causing us to miss our connecting flight and now we have to wait 18 hours for the next one with no access to checked baggage so no clothes and toiletries. Nearly every flight around us was expecting delays. Had a timer saying boarding in 15 mins when plane had not even arrived in the terminal yet. What's the point of timers if you're just going to lie. Not just the delays were the issue, the service desk only had 1 person working with a line of 15 people waiting due to multiple delays. Horrible service, will never fly with them again. This was our 4th flight this month have flown delta, united and Alaska airlines and all were so much better."
28,"✅ Trip Verified | Very happy with my first time flying with American Airlines. Boarding process was speedy, and we found ourselves very lucky as there were only 57 passengers on board allowing everyone to spread around the aircraft and have the chance to lie down for what turned out to be a longer than usual, 8 hour 15 minutes flight. Soon after take-off the crew came by with a hot meal, with a choice of either vegetarian pasta or a rice and chicken dish. I opted for the latter and it was surprisingly delicious. Around 2 hours before landing the crew came around again to hand some ice cream, and then they serviced us one more time shortly before landing to give everyone a hot pocket. The cabin crew were very nice and attentive, and throughout the whole flight walked around the cabin to ensure everyone was comfortable. Overall, quite happy with my experience and will fly American Airlines again in the future if I have the opportunity."
29,"Not Verified | I have experienced unforeseen travel situations with other airlines, including United and Southwest, both of which showed empathy and flexibility. Even though my tickets were nonrefundable, they worked with me to either change my flights for free or issue a full credit or refund. Their customer service demonstrated genuine care for their customers and valued loyalty. American Airlines, on the other hand, has shown me exactly why I will never book with them again. I found myself in an awkward situation needing to cancel a non-refundable flight that was meant to be a gift. Rather than allowing the full credit to be transferred to the recipient, American Airlines deducted the $99 cancellation fee from the credit (per their policy)—a fee that amounts to nearly half the cost of the original ticket. Instead of showing even the smallest amount of understanding, American Airlines rigidly clung to its policy, offering no meaningful assistance. The $99 fee has effectively diminished the value of what was supposed to be a thoughtful gift. This experience has not only been disappointing but feels needlessly punitive. I want to be clear: this situation wasn’t entirely within my control. I didn’t choose to book with American Airlines, nor was I the one to purchase the group flights without considering refundability. (We have a group of 15 with all flights booked at once by someone in the group who was trying to help out.) Yet somehow, I’m the one penalized because American Airlines refuses to provide flexibility in situations that clearly call for some level of human empathy. For context, I travel frequently—4 to 5 domestic trips per month for work—and I’ve been researching airline credit cards to decide which one best fits my needs as a frequent flyer. This may have been an inexpensive This may have been an inexpensive, leisurely trip, but with my business expense card, I'm enabled to travel business class for 3 to 6 trips per month. I can say with certainty that I will not be choosing American Airlines. This experience has solidified my preference for other airlines that consistently prioritize customer service, loyalty, and common sense. To anyone reading this, I urge you to think carefully before booking with American Airlines. There are plenty of other carriers that offer better customer service and greater flexibility when “life happens.” American Airlines may not care about losing a customer like me, but if they’re wondering why they don’t command the loyalty of frequent travelers, this situation should provide some insight. Goodbye, American Airlines. You’ve lost not just one potential loyal customer but also my trust and recommendation."
30,"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew American Airlines Flagship First from Sydney to New York. The flight from Sydney was fantastic with a great and attentive crew, excellent food and a super comfortable ly-flat bed. Took so long for the luggage that I barely made my connecting flight to New York. Domestic First Class seats on the A321 are a bit claustrophobic and not so comfortable - only 1 flight attendant for 10 pax but he tried his best and the food was average. SYD to LAX = 9/10 LAX to JFK = 6/10"
31,✅ Trip Verified |   American Airlines again fails to be on time and flight attendants are just rude. Every flight I took on this trip was delayed. We have tried to give them another chance but this is the last time we will be flying American.
32,"✅ Trip Verified |   American Airlines messed up our itinerary to St. Croix, now we have to spend the night sleeping on the concrete floor somewhere in San Juan airport until the first flight at 7am. All the hotels in San Juan are fully booked and nothing available. Rotten start to our vacation. Plus they have lost our luggage. This is the second time American Airlines has ruined a vacation leaving me stranded in a strange place"
33,"Not Verified |  Even though the flight was late and I paid for First class (not frequent flyer miles), they refused to allow me to enter the Admirals Club. While the service was good, I think the food made me sick. I've flown in coach on American and they tiniest, most cramped seats you can imagine. Shame on them for treating people like cattle."
34,"✅ Trip Verified |   I consider American Airlines a world-class carrier with aspirations for excellence, so when I sat down at my seat and found the touch screen was not working. I thought, “Ok, it’s fine; this sometimes happens. This is okay.” Then I put my arm on the armrest and was surprised to see that the entire armrest was covered in duct tape, and I thought to myself, “Duct tape? really?!” If I rent a car, and upon getting in, find the seat is covered with duct tape, I would consider this unacceptable. So, for American Airlines, which has aspirations for excellence. My question is this: Is this acceptable?"
35,"Not Verified |  We were flying 2 legs with American airlines: DTW (Detroit) to DFW (Dallas), DFW to MEX (Mexico city). On the way there, our flight was delayed, and we just barely got to our other flight in time. then, they lost our checked luggage. the worst part is, we were flying with another airline to another destination in Mexico, and simply couldn't wait. The airline staff was either rude, or they didn't know what they were talking about for our lost luggage. The airline then took 2-4 days to get it back to us, near the end of our trip. they also refused to answer our phone calls to customer service. we sat, on hold, for over 5 hours just for them to hang up. On our way back, we got stranded in DFW and it was American airlines' fault! It was a real hassle due to their truly awful customer service."
36,"Not Verified |  Sonya at the MBJ Counter of American Airlines was attentive and addressed my concerns professionally, and in a timely manner. She is definitely an asset to the organization."
37,"✅ Trip Verified |   This was an awful experience. Avoid American Airlines at all costs. First, they changed our itinerary and forced us to add 3 hours flight time and a 4 hour layover to our trip. Next, our flight was delayed due to mechanical issues with the plane but they wouldn't tell us what was happening they just continued to delay for short periods of time so we couldn't leave the gate area and couldn't make other arrangements. Then they announced a new gate, new aircraft and boarding time and again started announcing delays without explanation. The second plane was eventually taken out of service as unrepairable and a third gate and flight was assigned. This time they let us now the departure time was uncertain because they didn't have a crew (it was Thanksgiving and getting late). We finally got them to agree to change our reservation to another airline with a flight leaving later in the evening and they assured us that they would transfer our baggage because they had over an hour and a half. In total, we spent over thirteen hours in Dallas/Ft. Worth airport, our original 4 hour layover and an additional 9 hour delay. Our arrival in Madrid, originally scheduled for early the next morning ended up being 2:30 in the afternoon and we still had to wait for the baggage which, of course, did not make it onto our flight. One whole day in Madrid gone. After i posted a complaint with American Airlines I received one phone message from someone who never returned my phone calls and several apologetic messages without any offers of compensation or resolution. Ultimately they gave me 7500 air miles while they researched my claim and in keeping with their policy of customer neglect, no real satisfaction. I will certainly never fly American again."
38,"✅ Trip Verified |   My nephew and I traveled to Cuba and we were overcharged $165 each for a bags that they considered overweight or oversized, even though, their website states the following: “Each passenger traveling to Cuba may only check up to 2 bags* with a maximum weight of 70 lbs / 32 kgs per bag, plus 1 carry-on bag and 1 personal item” Trips originating outside Cuba. Bag 1 Bag 2 Bag 3 To Cuba. $0 / $35*^ $150 / $200**^ $200 They charged $400 for each of us. I have different phone calls and they refused to get back our money. On top of that, last phone call they hang out. On top of that, they left behind a check in bag in miami when returning back, the bag was broken and also refused to pay what it cost. It was a bad experience and I hope I don’t have to travel with them anymore."
39,✅ Trip Verified |   Very rude staff at YYZ and even worse at MIA. They have no manners in speaking with passengers. Very impatient with seniors that required assistance using the totems to check in.
40,"✅ Trip Verified |   This airline is awful. They have no regard for you as a passenger. We are delayed 30 hours and counting. Just as we are preparing for take off on a 15 hour flight, the Captain realizes he is over his hours. Now we sit on the plane and wait for a new Captain? I had a similar experience returning from Peru in August 2024. The most frustrating part is the complete indifference towards the passengers. I was a loyal customer. Now I just hate this company and will do my best to avoid them in the future."
41,"Not Verified | Multiple flight changes without any notice of gate or flight change. Left New Orleans at 3 am, it is now 8.45pm and still waiting on a delayed flight. 6 of the American Airlines flights are delayed at this time. Will never fly American again, would rather rent a car and drive for days. Will try Delta next time. Pathetic customer service."
42,"Not Verified |  We left 2 hours late, then diverted to Tulsa with no explanation. Left sitting on the plane for 10 hours with no food and no water. They did not help us find or even offer to help find ways to our destination We lost our once in a lifetime trip, NFL game tickets and hotel. We were given no hotel voucher and no flight home. We were stranded in Dallas, had to rent a car to drive home and pay for our hotel. There is no person you can talk to because they don't have a phone number to even call customer service. I will absolutely never fly AA again."
43,"Not Verified |  
I tagged my luggage, as we were boarding I noticed my luggage was left behind. The stewardess just said I don't know what to tell you. I had noticed way before & asked before we boarded. They just said ok just keep an eye on it. We traveled to NY and on way back our flight was canceled then rescheduled to 3 connecting flights and overlay of 8 hours. We're getting home a day late."
44,"✅ Trip Verified |   Had two delays that caused us to miss our connecting flight on the 24th, and even after getting a new flight scheduled, we had to wait over 30 extra minutes because of more maintenance issues. American Airlines has made this whole Christmas Holiday Hell. I can't spend Christmas day with my family because I have to wait for this flight and go to work within an hour after landing. This is my absolute worst flight experience ever!"
45,"Not Verified | We arrived to the airport at 2:30am for our 5am flight. None of the staff were available until 3:30am. They were very rude to customer, even tho they were the ones that came in and started late. Also, my wife and I are both Active Duty military members and they didn't give us our TSA pre-check even after ID and order verification. I've traveled all over the world and this has to be one of the most poor airport experience I've ever had in my life."
46,"✅ Trip Verified |   My Thanksgiving flight began in Detroit at 7am. The first connection in Dallas had over a 9 hr delay. Two planes were taken out of service due to mechanical issues. Two flight crews timed out waiting. At 9pm they had found a third plane and were looking for a flight crew that was available. The flight that was to take off at 1:40pm finally took off just before 11pm. Due to the delay my connection in Madrid was rebooked 3 times and ultimately rerouted to Jerez, Spain. There I was to board the cruise at the second port. Due to the delay, rebooked flights and rerouted flight my luggage was lost. I was reunited with it on day 5 of the cruise. American Airlines customer service is mostly nonexistent. For my trouble AA is offering 10000 miles. That is unacceptable!"
47,Not Verified |  They canceled my flight in the middle of the night and when I got to the airport they wanted me to take a 10:35pm flight (original flight 09:55am). They did not offer me anything additional for them canceling my flight and leaving me to figure out how to get to back to my home city. Since then I now have to stay an additional night at another hotel before I can get home. No incentive if you want to book with American Airline just know the possibility of being left to check in with another hotel and your flight being canceled on a whim.
48,"✅ Trip Verified |   I recently traveled on American Airlines in business class and had an excellent experience. Despite a slight delay due to crew staffing, the team handled it with professionalism. Once onboard, we were promptly offered a pre-departure beverage, which was a nice touch. During the flight, which lasted just over an hour, the service was impeccable, with a full-service offering that far exceeded my expectations for a short flight. The captain and flight attendants went out of their way to apologize for the delay, and their politeness and attention to safety stood out. Overall, it was a very positive and enjoyable journey."
49,"✅ Trip Verified |   The experience with American Airlines, and the lack of respect from their part to us, passengers is overwhelming, there is no one single flight I took that depart on time, the word on time for American Airlines doesn't exist, the lack of professionalism to resolve issues will always surprise you for the worst, Im suppose to arrived to Atlanta at 7pm today, guess, its 6.19pm and we still in Miami, it's been an hour in the airplane at the gate door, waiting first for mechanical issues and now for pilots, not a voucher, not a refund, or partial refund, nothing is offered to us for wasting our time after charging skyrocket prices for a flight"
50,"✅ Trip Verified |   I traveled business class with American Airlines and encountered an appalling experience with the baggage service staff at PDX Airport.  Upon discovering that my luggage was damaged, I approached the baggage service counter to file a claim. Instead of assisting me, the staff misled me by claiming that claims could only be filed through customer support. They forced me to leave the baggage service area and insisted my bags were not damaged. To make matters worse, a staff member who identified herself as a supervisor used derogatory language and laughed at me. When I contacted customer support the following day, I was informed that claims could be filed at the airport and that the staff should have assisted me if I was unable to use the QR code. Acting on this information, I returned to the airport on July 25, only to face the same unprofessional staff. They not only refused to assist me again but also yelled at me, humiliated me further with derogatory remarks, and denied me the ability to file a claim. Following this incident, I emailed the manager to express my concerns. He assured me that my complaint would be escalated to HR and upper management. However, I have yet to receive a response or see any indication of an investigation into the abusive behavior and refusal of service. This lack of accountability has further eroded my trust in American Airlines. This experience has highlighted the severe inadequacies in American Airlines’ customer service and staff behavior. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. The treatment I endured reflects poorly on their commitment to professionalism, respect, and customer care. I urge potential customers to consider other airlines and avoid American Airlines."
51,Not Verified |  Flew on December 11 with AA1572 from Toronto to Miami. Check in with dog in cabin went extremely smoothly and was actually a pleasant experience. As during lunch hour Terminal 3 in Toronto is fairly empty security control and USA passport control was very quick. Boarding started a few minutes early and was civilized. Experience on board in business class was nice and pleasant. Excellent flight attendant and to my surprise the served lunch was one of the best inflight meals I ever had on this route. Arrival a bit before time and even the checked bag arrived quickly. All in all - could not have been a better experience. All perfect.
52,"✅ Trip Verified |   I became ill on the flight out of Heathrow. As we approached LAX I asked for a wheelchair, and subsequently was taken to the emergency room. I was hospitalized for several days, during which I called American about my reservation. I explained the circumstances and was told they were holding open my reservation (first class from LAX to Phoenix). When I called the next day to rebook, they had no record of my reservation or the conversation. I gave them my ticket number and they found my record but offered absolutely no credit for my original business/first class ticket. They did however offer to sell me a ticket in the main cabin. (I hung up and used my points for a ticket home on Southwest.) This is a terrible excuse for customer service, and I will make a point of avoiding American in the future, even if I have to pay more to a competitor."
53,"✅ Trip Verified | I have travelled all over the world on multiple airlines and have never had confrontations with the attendants or felt compelled to submit a review. However, this trip with American Airlines was a disaster. On the trip out to CA, every plane was late (not a terrible thing). On the trip from Ontario, CA to Pensacola, FL (with a layover in Dallas, TX), the plane in Ontario was on time, but because of an earlier flight that had mechanical troubles, the flight was packed and several of those passengers were stuck for several hours and missed connections. The real problem was at the loading gate in Dallas on the final leg to Pensacola. The gate attendant was arbitrarily picking people out to have their carry-on bags checked to make room on the overhead bins. He singled my backpack out and told me to place it in the device they use to check if it will fit in the bins. My backpack fit, but he still wanted to check it. I argued with him about it as several bags that were obviously larger than mine rolled onto the flight. After removing my computer, the attendant told me I could take the backpack on and hold my computer. I was extremely frustrated by then and while packing up my backpack I mumbled under my breath ""dumb ass."" The attendant heard this and returned to me and told me I could not board the flight. I apparently hurt his feelings, and he felt that was sufficient to kick me from the flight. I was allowed onto the flight after his supervisor came over but had already called my ride from Pensacola to home to stop them from coming to the airport. I strongly advise avoiding American Airlines if you have to travel through Dallas. The airline has empowered their thin-skinned attendants to ruin your trip for arbitrary reasons. You don't have to pose a danger to the flight."
54,"✅ Trip Verified |   On Nov 23rd I had an award reservation from CLT to JFK booked main class with a seating upgrade voucher to premium seating. I placed myself standby on the earlier flight, I checked in early at the airport and was number 2 of 13 passengers. I informed the gate agent she replied 35 minutes before boarding seating would be assigned. American Airlines assigns seating according to the standby list to my dismay she placed me economy in row 32C by the bathroom and gave all the passengers on standby after me premium seating. I did inform her of my premium seating voucher used for my confirmed flight. She lied and said the computer assigns the seating. Upon my return to CLT I asked a reservation agent had American changed their practice on assigning standby seating they replied no therefore it leads me to believe I was discriminated against by this gate agent cause I was African-American. To this review American has failed to give me a reply on the complaint I filed. ""American Airlines November 23, 2024 Hello, Thank you for contacting American Airlines Customer Relations.

55,"Not Verified |  I recently flew with American Airlines and experienced the best service ever on a 3 star airline ever for example cabin crew (Kim) went over and beyond my expectations she was so friendly in serving us dinner and made sure we had a safe and comfortable flight she also gave me a couple compliments which I thought was very nice of her, seat/legroom was fabulous. There was no entertainment but, I was able to watch some movies on my laptop and the movie options were spectacular. There was onboard wifi which was nice, ground service was fast and efficient since a TSA helped us and the check-in guy was very friendly in offering us the boarding pass even though my dad said no, food was very very delicious. Landing/departure in Santa Ana and Miami were very smooth, value for money was over and beyond my expectations. Will fly with them again!"
56,"✅ Trip Verified |   Just wanted to put in a good word since there are so many complaints. JFK to DFW encountered a storm at DFW and were diverted to a nearby small airport. We did have to sit there for a while, but the storm had caused havoc to all flights. Crew was fine. We got back to DFW around midnight and had to spend the night in a nearby hotel (all very full due to storm, but found one) and booked a flight for the next day - we did this on our own, not through Customer Service (too long a line). At check-in, the agent found a sooner faster flight for us, which was great. Back home, I wrote an email to AA customer service requesting reimbursement for hotel and taxi, which they are not required to due when delays are caused by weather. They wrote back within an hour, apologized for the inconvenience and asked for the receipts. The next day they sent approval and within a few days I received a check for the full amount. I thought they did a great job under the circumstances. The rest of the flight(s) was normal - I don't fly for fine dining nor do I expect anything beyond the normal - older planes a little less fun, newer ones better. So I'm just commenting on the Customer Service which was great."
57,"✅ Trip Verified | This is why I chose again and again to pay more for my international flights because of the rude and poor stuck up attitude of American Airlines air steward. I came in asking for help with my luggage because I was juggling with a lot of other things (including a baby etc) and this steward said sure but proceed to “air lift” his hands were NOT touching my luggage and said “please leave most of them and I can help after”. After what? After I lift it up myself? Then he proceed to say it’s not in his contract to help. This is not the first time I am appalled at American Airlines attitude. You’re in service industry. If helping is not in your bone go get yourself an office job. Total disgrace and why American airline will NEVER be close to any leading airlines like Emirates, Singapore or Qatar. Please do better and train your staff."
58,"✅ Trip Verified |   AA from the US in business class is normally ok, this was the return flight from Cancun to Phoenix, but is similar on all AA flights from out of the country back to the US. The counter person was announcing the flight and absolutely no one standing nearby could understand what she was saying, either English or Spanish. When the announcement to board came, no one knew whether it was priority, group 1, so everyone just swarmed to board, which meant that priority, group 1 passengers had to wait in line, about 15 minutes snaking down the ramp, to get to row 2. Nothing was offered to drink for business class while waiting to depart, not even water. There are 16 seats in first/business class. The attendant started taking menu choices from the rear row, when she arrived at row 2 there was NO OPTION, there was sea bass. We’re coming from an island where we had fresh fish and lobster for 8 days and we are given fish while heading home. This is inexcusable to not prep enough meals for a 16 section business class. As you can imagine, the sea bass with couscous was underwhelming. The offered dessert was a banana something, and having flown business class for 30 years I can honestly say it was the worst excuse for a dessert offering I have ever had - in appearance, taste, freshness, simply mediocre. Even though business class anymore always seems to be full, these seats are not cheap but the service from out of the US back in seems to be dropping rapidly to a point where it is nothing more than extra legroom. All airlines are pretty much the same, the only step from here is private flights."
59,"✅ Trip Verified |   They disrespect loyalty, & status. I have been united 1k for 4 years, never will recommend American. They reassigned my ticket in front of me, even when I was 15min before departure. Travel on your own risk, get are monopoly you can avoid them I got platinum pro this year, will go back to United"
60,"Not Verified |  Delayed flight out of Miami over two hours causing us to miss connecting flight to Portland. Rebooked automatically to have us fly to Phoenix and be stranded overnight and take a flight to Portland Wednesday 11/13 in the morning. Flight in Miami delayed again so we would miss our rebooked connecting flight in Miami to phoenix so stranded in Miami overnight. Rebooked flight from Miami to PDX but it is not a nonstop like original, have a layover in Texas. American Airlines Booked us a hotel overnight only to show up and have them tell us there is no rooms available, this forced us to go back to airport to stay there overnight with our two kids. This forced us to pay for an Uber back to the airport. In total we are now going to arrive home more than 16 hours later from the original time that was booked. Loss of wages for two people, pet sitter additional day and night, uber rides to hotel, both kids miss school, extra day of parking fees at airport"
61,"✅ Trip Verified |   This complaint is due to a mechanical problem which caused me to miss my connecting flight. I stood in line for 45 minutes at the help desk to receive a voucher as promised. Upon receipt of a free hotel and a $12.00 food credit, I left to pick up my luggage, which was pulled at my originating airport to be picked up in Dallas ft worth since I knew ahead of time I would have to spend the night in Dallas and was told I would receive a voucher for my hotel along with my luggage. I waited for all the bags to come off and my luggage was not there as promised. I went out to call the hotel, and the phone just went voicemail after numerous attempts. I googled the address of the hotel, and could not get anyone to answer to even get a ride to the hotel. After having this happen to me on a previous trip with American Airlines, where I received a voucher to a hotel, got a bus to the hotel and there were no reservations available. I realized I did not want To pay for an uber to a hotel that clearly either wasn’t in business anymore or were overbooked. I realized that since it was after 9:00pm, I would need to secure my own hotel. I got the last room at the Hyatt which was almost $500. I called every low cost hotel in the area and there were no rooms. I left early the next morning for my charlotte connection and went to use my food voucher and was told it was only good at Dallas ft worth airport. I was told at the help desk it was good at any airport on my itinerary. I arrived home with no luggage until the following day. It was raining, and the courier service just dropped it in the pouring rain and drove off, not even ringing my doorbell. My luggage is expensive Hartman tweed favric and was soaked. I sent a complaint to the customer relations department to complain and was told that although they understood my frustration, they would not be sending me one penny for the vouchers that were of no value. If a company promises vouchers yet won’t stand by them, they are dishonest and lack integrity."
62,"Not Verified | I had an incredibly disappointing experience with American Airlines On November 5th landed from PVD to PHL. We were told to standby for the connecting flight to MBJ. After spending over 5 hours in the airport gate lounge. They canceled the flight and rescheduled a flight for November 6th. The airline staff was very rude and did not offer any suggestions or a hotel accommodations. Suggested we collect our luggage and re-board/book the next morning. The group reported to baggage claim. The attendant strongly suggested do NOT checkout your luggage. The luggage will follow on to the next flight. As well as, suggested the Airport Marriott. Appreciated his input. American Airlines already made up their minds to rescheduled a flight for November 6th. Disregarding customer service or respect."
63,"✅ Trip Verified |   I had an incredibly disappointing experience with this airline. I had initially requested assistance for my flights, but decided to cancel assistance for departing due to having my own support. For the remaining journey, the airline failed me terribly. On the flight from Reagan Airport to Toronto, no assistance was provided, and I visibly struggled while waiting for everyone to board. Although my carry-on met all regulations and was allowed on all my previous flights, I was forced to check it this time. Despite explaining that without assistance retrieving my bags at the claim would be almost impossible, I was assured there would be support in Toronto and given a valet pickup tag for my luggage. Regrettably, no assistance appeared upon arrival, forcing me to struggle down the ramp outside. Furthermore, my luggage wasn't available at the valet pickup, so I had to struggle all the way to baggage claim. It was truly horrible"
64,"✅ Trip Verified |   We started our trip home with American Airlines with a delay, we got there early, well you cant check your bags until 4 hours before flights. We’re early because of having to drop a car off and wasn’t sure how long that would take. So we ended up having to sit on the cold floor, because there was limited seating . After a long delay we finally reach Chicago airport, get to our gate and we find out we’re delayed again, according to the pilot they sent our crew some where else, I’m sure someone knew way before we were informed, leaving us wondering who’s flight was more important then ours! They took our crew, but no one seemed to think hey get another crew right away. Finally a crew shows up and as I’m checking in there was a woman calling for help because an older man almost collapsed asking for a wheel chair to help him board the plane , all 4 staff just stood there and didn’t even rush to help a customer! The guy taking my ticket told her His words not mind “Jesus Christ just give us a break” that’s when I walked on the plane. I contacted customer service and even though this was the Airlines fault the best they could was a $ 50 trip voucher. How insulting is that! Worst part of our trip was flying with American airline!"
65,"✅ Trip Verified |   Not much I can say that hasn’t already been said, other than that it’s all true. I’ve been a frequent flyer for 23 years now, and I can confidently state that of all the airlines I’ve flown, AA by far has the worst customer service, even within the US, which is already a very low bar. Delays, cancellations, and other problems are bound to happen with any airline, but the flippant, glib and couldn’t care less attitude with which these are handled by the AA staff is infuriating. Stay away."
66,"✅ Trip Verified | I purchased a Flagship 1st Class ticket for a long haul, lie flat seat to Rome from Dallas. The price was approximately $3800 dollars with a standard ticket costing about $700 at the time. Due to a knee injury, it was important for me to have the ability to lie flat, which is why I purchased that specific seat type. Upon boarding the flight, I was unaware my seat was broken. After the flight reached a safe altitude to adjust our seats, the captain allowed us to unbuckle our seatbelts and walk around the cabin. I realized my electronic control panel was not working and I was unable to move my seat. I called Michelle and Mats, the flight attendants serving our area, and notified them of the issue. Michelle let me know the seat was known to be broken and could not be adjusted through the control panel due to a power failure. Any seat manipulation would require it to be done manually by two flight attendants. I requested another seat due to seeing a couple available, and she informed me they were for the cabin crew. So, I let her know I needed to figure something out due to my seat being broken. She then requested another attendant to help her manually move the seat, and after attempting this, the seat jammed and was left pushed forward with the seat back leaning forward, as well. For the entire duration of the flight, 10+hours, I was unable to sit upright, recline, nor was I able to use any electronic functionality of my seat. Furthermore, due to the seat being stuck leaning forward, the tray table to eat was also unable to be opened, so I had an issue with dining. Michelle realized this was an issue and contacted American Airlines Customer Relations during the flight to request they reach out to me about this ordeal. Michelle let me know that AA knows about damaged seats and plane issues but were opting to wait for major renovations to their fleet in October. I questioned why they would sell a premium seat knowing the seat was damaged, and she told me it is a known frustration throughout multiple flight attendants. No matter what, American will not refund my money. "
67,"✅ Trip Verified |   Both flights were on time and very smooth. Plenty of legroom in the Main Cabin Extra seats. Connecting to inflight WiFi was very easy with a good selection of movies, music and live tv. Flight crew was very pleasant providing friendly and efficient service."
68,"✅ Trip Verified |   In my opinion, the crew was not concerned about flight safety. I was seated in the emergency exit row at seat 17A. The crew only asked the passengers sitting in the emergency exit rows for verbal confirmation that we would assist in evacuating passengers, although three of them were elderly. One of them had difficulty moving and appeared to be over 80 years old! I respect the elderly, but how can a person help in a real-life emergency if they cannot respond quickly? The emergency exits were cluttered with passengers’ hand luggage, and none of the crew asked to place it in the overhead compartments, which had enough space available. On the next flight, all 12 seats in the emergency exit row were empty, which contradicts safety regulations. In the event of an emergency, there would be no passengers who were briefed and responsible for opening the emergency exits. This would hinder an effective evacuation of the passengers. In my 8 years of working in aviation, I have never seen such disregard for safety."
69,"Not Verified | Due to an accident that occured on my way to the airport I was unable to make it in time for my flight from Tampa to Charleston, so I purchased a new flight same day to Charleston - unbeknownst to me my following flight was also canceled with absolutely no recourse offered by the airline even though the flight still had availability I would have had to purchase a new ticket with absolutely no credit. That to me is deplorable and predatory practice and the customer service agent I spoke to was rude and completely unapologetic about the matter as well. I will never fly with that airline again."
70,"✅ Trip Verified |   We purchased their main cabin extra seats for the extra leg room and location of seats. We chose our seats at the time of purchase. After flying into Dallas for our connection we were informed that our seats had been moved to standard seats. I called and was told I'd receive a refund within 24 hours. When I didn't I called again and was told I had to call after our trip was completed. So I did and was told I had to email them for the refund. So I did. Now I'm being told that they won't refund me because those seats are 'if available'. How do you charge someone $140 extra per seat, have them chose the seat and then tell them they're not available but keep their money? What a scam. And to top it off we paid for seats together and were switched on 3 out of 4 flights and were nowhere near each other."
71,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst flight experience ever. Old outdated plane. Uncomfortable cramped seats with the shortest leg room I have ever seen in a long haul flight. Makes Ryanair feels premium in comparison. On top of that for what ever reason, at last minute before boarding they asked me checkin my hand luggage because overhead compartments were supposedly full. But once in the plane, it was obvious half of the overhead compartments were empty. Is this what the supposedly most advanced country in the world has to offer as a company?"
72,"✅ Trip Verified |   American 'delayed' Airlines does it again! An hour and a half delay, with annoyed employees and an email I received that said the gate changed when it didn't. Why do I continue to fly with this miserable airline? Well, if there is a specific airport I want to fly out of, on a specific day and time, sometimes AA is the only choice I have."
73,✅ Trip Verified |   This will be the last time I fly American. I was forced to check my bag even though I saw we had bin space. I had a bag sent to be picked up for not other reason the young lady boarding the plane’s arrogance and her unwillingness to listen. The plane had plenty of overhead space. I asked if I could have my carry on with me. This isn’t the first time something like this happened. The stewardess attempted to get my bag on board. However the rep letting us on the plane rolled her eyes and refused and said I’d have to wait. Three empty bins from my count.
74,"✅ Trip Verified |   The workers in TSA in Logan airport are rude and act like they are on a power trip. They wouldn’t accept my son’s ID, the guy was shaking his head at me. The TSA workers singled me and my disabled son out checking out bags rifling through them carelessly saying that there were chemicals on our bags. Telling us to “stand over there!” Very rudely. The plane we went on had an hour delay. Then we get another surprise and had to pay an extra $115 for seats that I thought I already paid for. I couldn’t sit next to my autistic son, even though I had to pay extra for our seats and my son was vomiting on the plane. I will never fly with American Airlines ever again. "
75,"✅ Trip Verified |   American Airlines cancels or delays half of their flights. They offer no refunds, no reimbursement, and no apologies for wasting days of peoples’ lives. They will not ensure you make connecting flights. They will simply continue to overbook and underperform. Fly any other airline and save yourself the trouble. Literally any other airline. "
76,"✅ Trip Verified |   My flight from Miami, FL to Puerto Rico was delayed by 2 hours. 200 passengers sat in the plane for over two hours with very little air flow while we waited for the extremely late pilot to arrive. Afterwards we didn't get any kind of apology from American Airlines. No flight credits or even an email that said sorry. We suffered for 2 hours in the Miami heat waiting for a late pilot and American Airlines did nothing about it!!This is what you can expect from these big corporations now. It wasn't long ago that my tax dollars bailed these airlines out and they can't even bother to apologize when they make a mistake."
77,"✅ Trip Verified |   This issue sets a precedent that I didn’t know possible. I am a a platinum member of AA since 2006 , purchased a confirmed business class American Airline ticket to India code shared with Qatar Airways. On my return, I checked online a day ahead as usual but on the night of the flight when I went to the counter at the airport Qatar only issued me a boarding pass to DOH not to my final destination to Chicago, I was told that AA has cancelled my 2nd leg after so many calls with AA customer service , i was rudely informed that AA has the right to cancel all or part of any confirmed ticket involuntarily without explanation and they did an involuntarily cancellation to my ticket. Qatar Airways got me an economy Class ticket on the 2nd leg, AA has cancelled the 2nd leg of my flight and would have left me stranded in a foreign country."
78,"✅ Trip Verified |   I booked a flight from Colombia to Washington State with American Airlines, which included an 11-hour journey with a 1-hour and 35-minute layover in Miami. Unfortunately, this was insufficient time for customs, and I arrived just as the gate was closing. American Airlines should have known that Miami was a busy airport and that this layover was too short for a smooth connection. When I arrived, they directed me to their ""rebooking counter."" I had never encountered such a counter before, but it turns out they have at least two, staffed by 4-5 employees, likely due to frequent rebookings. There was even a sign indicating that they often overbook flights. They managed to book me on a flight the next morning that would stop in Dallas, arriving in Seattle at 3 PM the following day. When I asked to speak with the manager, she was dismissive and told me that they were only legally obligated to provide a layover of between 90 minutes and 2 hours. She added that if I had been flying to Canada or the UK, they would have had to provide hotel accommodations and meals, but because my final destination was within the U.S., they had no obligation to assist me. She insisted I should feel fortunate to be rebooked at all. This led to a long night spent at Miami airport. The next morning, my flight to Dallas was delayed on the tarmac for over two hours because one of the engines wouldn't start, necessitating a mechanic's intervention. As a result, I arrived in Dallas 15 minutes after my connecting flight had left. I had to return to the rebooking counter yet again, where I finally secured a new flight for 5 PM. Ultimately, I arrived home a full 21 hours later than my original schedule."
79,"✅ Trip Verified |   There are two airlines that fly from Philadelphia to Seattle non-stop in the afternoons, Alaska or American. I go with American because I think the regular economy seats are more comfortable if comparing the two airlines. This trip however, I did pay $68 dollars more for the extra room seat in row 12. For a 5.5 hour flight it is so worth it. There was nobody in the middle seat either. The trip to Seattle from Philly the plane left on time and there were no problems. I do love American Airlines mobile app. You don't need to print boarding passes, you can purchase your checked baggage ahead of time. Best of all, if you need to make a transfer in a confusing or large airport, they provide a step by step map for you. This was a life saver for me on the return trip to Philly which first stopped in DFW. The flight from Seattle left a half hour late, which caused me some minor anxiety on the way to DFW (because there was only a 40 minute gap between the 2 flights on a normal schedule). The pilot did make up some ground on the way to DFW, so we landed on time, but I lost 20 of the 40 minutes I had taxiing to the gate, and physically getting off the plane. Stupidly I had sat in the back for that flight, lesson learned! So dramatically I had to run a little to the Skytrain escalator, and go to level 5, but at least I knew where I was going thanks to the AA App! The train took 10 minutes, then I ran down the escalator, and jogged to the gate where I made it to the gate to Philly with 3 minutes to spare! I couldn't believe it I was just so happy that I made the flight and if they waited for me and my bags, thank you I really appreciate it! That 3 hour flight from DFW to Philly was great, they had pretzels for snacks and again I sprung for the more expensive seat in row 12. What a day that was! One of my return luggage pieces, was a 36 lb. box of beer cans and crowlers from Seattle that I packed up myself and gratefully it survived loading, take off, landing and unloading twice! Yay!! Even though this airline is poorly rated I can tolerate it because I always fly after 12 noon, and usually late afternoons, when there are hardly any wait times for security checkpoints in airports, planes aren't fully sold out and the flight attendants seemed to be more chill."
80,"Not Verified | Once again my flight was delayed. I travelled September 28th from tampa to New-York. I was supposed to be there around 5pm but we landed at 8pm. I missed the reason for what I went. My ride left without me so I had to book a hotel for the night and came back September 29th from New-Jersey to Tampa. This flight was delayed too. We were supposed to land at 9pm at Miami and I had connection at 10:15 for tampa. I missed this flight too. When we landed before getting off the plane, nobody was in any of American Airlines gates. One guys told me to go to receptiin and there I found an agent who told me AA can not provide hotel because it was not AA fault. Was it my fault if the flights were delayed? And the next flight from Miami to Tampa will be at 5:11am ""if it is on time"" . I have life, I have my job. I missed why I went to NY it like I went for nothing because of AA. I am going to miss my work tomorrow and I can be fired because I did not tell to any of my managers or took days off. If you can, avoid this company. You will lose your connections flight, your money, even your desire to travel."
81,"Not Verified |  I checked into my flight at the desk, went through security, then before getting on the plane American Airlines told me they had over sold my flight and they no longer had a seat for me! How do they get away with this! I purchased my ticket weeks in advance. How does this not secure me a seat on the plane? They put me on a United airlines flight later in the day, told me my bag would be forwarded on, and it never was. 10 days later, my bag and everything in it is officially ""lost"" and no one can tell me where it is. Thanks American Airlines for overselling my flight, kicking me off at the last minute, then loosing my luggage. Your customer service team has been terrible. No accountability. Absolutely terrible."
82,Not Verified |  Booked a flight from Atlanta to Scranton and back. Depart flight left Atlanta stopped in charlotte and then connection - as expected. Return was a bus booked through aa.com. This feels like fraud (not an expert - I'm assuming there's some way they can get away with this). I hope at least some of you can save themself this horror and book an airline that uses all planes. My ticket shows four plane icons ... one for every leg of the trip.
83,"✅ Trip Verified |   Having booked direct flights with return, outward was changed to one stop, return changed to 5 hrs later landing time. At airport, flight delayed, all of which can happen with any airline, however American do not issue apologies, even asking customers on boarding to please hurry as flight is already delayed, without a hint of an apology. The departing gate on return was changed several times, leading to us walking up and down airport again without an apology, the need to vigilant with app & airport info paramount, no American airline reps in sight."
84,Not Verified | Our initial flight was at 6:17 then changed to 7:29 but was delayed until 9:10. First maintenance issue then a passenger wanted to get off so they had to get just luggage off the plane then we waited for the push off from the terminal. Absolutely unbelievable. We weren’t offered any credits for future flights. We will never fly American Airlines EVER again.
85,"✅ Trip Verified |   My husband and I purchased tickets from ILM to DTW on 6/9/24 to go home over labor day weekend. We were going home to Michigan from North Carolina to introduce our 4 month old to our family. We departed ILM on 8/30, this flight was initially delayed taking off to CLT due to a mechanical issue. This late departure caused us to hit severe storms around the CLT airport leaving our plane unable to land in CLT for which we were re-routed to Greensburg-Spartanburg, SC airport. We sat on the tarmac (not being allowed off the plane) for 4 hours with our 4 month old and our dog onboard. When we were finally allowed to go back to CLT our plane to DTW had taken off ~20 minutes prior to us landing resulting in that flight to be missed. When we landed, the flight attendants promised us that there would be an agent at the gate to help us all rebook our flights. After all of the passengers deboarded, that attendant at the gate helped 3 people and then left the rest of us standing there with no explanation or help, never coming back. I was finally able to get our flight rebooked for 11am on 8/31 and then we went to collect our luggage and, to my surprise, an AA employee in baggage claim told us our bags were going to be sent to our final destination regardless of rebooking and refused to give us back our car seat for our 4 month baby. After AA left us stranded in CLT (3 hours away from our home in ILM) we had to book a hotel to stay overnight and had no car seat for our baby making those rides extremely dangerous. AA refused to refund our tickets and baggage fees because we ""rebooked our flights"". We had NO choice but to rebook because our car seat would have been sent to Michigan anyways and there was no way were were taking a 3 hour car ride back to ILM with no car seat for our baby. Then on the following flight for 8/31, our flight was delayed again due to a missing flight attendant, for which no one knew where she was."
86,"Not Verified |  We had a very poor experience after a delay caused us to miss our connecting flight. Our class of service was downgraded and when we attempted to get a refund for the difference in fare price, were offered a ridiculously small amount as a refund. After multiple e-mail requests, we were continually referred back to the AA web form for complaints, no one would call to speak to me, and the refund amount was not adjusted. It's rare that I experience customer service this poor. AA should be ashamed at the way it treats it's customers."
87,"✅ Trip Verified |   Worst Airline ever! ATL-CLT Flight on 8/10/24 held to allow (2) non-flying pilots board the plane which created a chain reaction to a horrible experience. Missed our connecting flight to Aruba. Paid for 1st class, and rest of trip had to fly Main. Hassle rescheduling in CLT as well. Lodging provided in Houston was deplorable. Room smelled. Trip to Aruba was for a marriage proposal and stress of not knowing where our luggage was awful. Lost a day in Aruba as well (~$900/night) at Bucuti and Tara Beach Resort. After the missed connection flight, dealing with AA was an awful experience. First AA booked us flights thru Dulles with one of us flying standby to Aruba on an oversold flight! What a hassle with 90% of the reps we worked with to get to Aruba. We chose AA as we wanted to sit together in first class for this special trip (she was not aware of the pending marriage proposal). Our experience with AA was the worst experience we both have ever had flying and could have been avoided had the initial flight not been delayed for (2) late non-flying, non-paying pilots to catch a flight back to CLT. I blame AA 100% for this horrendous experience. Their lack of consideration for the customer is enough to avoid this airline going forward. Upon returning home, dealing with Customer Service seeking retribution was just as awful. Never again!!"
88,"Not Verified |  American Airlines is delayed, hence I missed my connection flight, instead of rebooking my tickets, they sent me to Cathay which is my connection flight. Cathay said they can't help, because it's AA that is delayed so they have to rebook you. Customer is being treated like a number/toy, passed around back and forth like a ball. After rebooked me to Qatar, then they said you have to wait around for 7 hours here. I am standing here with 5 yo daughter, unable to get in, haven't had food/drink for 14 hrs. Never again fly AA! They don't care about you even if you pay the most expensive tickets, you are just a number."
89,"✅ Trip Verified |   I was flying from Miami to San Diego on 6th of September by American Airlines. It was one of my flights that day. My starting point was Muscat, Oman. It was an exhausting day after multiple flights and this flight was going to be the last one. I bought a business class ticket. The were two things that happened. First of all, my seat was broken: I can't even understand how could that have happened in business class and no one of the crew noticed it. Secondly, the stewardess was really rude to me. I told her about the problem with the seat, but she didn't care at all. In fact, she started shouting at me, saying that she wouldn't transfer me to another seat, and that she could only put me at the seat that was near the toilet. However, that seat didn't lean back and it was in economy class.  I was offended in front of many people as well as this flight was one of the most uncomfortable I've had in my whole life. I don't recommend this airline to anyone. You will spend money for nothing, no service, awful behavior. They don't even want to make a refund for that, just leaving me with raw apologies. Hopefully, I have helped someone to make a right decision after this review."
90,"Not Verified |  Appalling service. Gave me a voucher that did not work after a flight I was on was immediately landed due to ""mechanical failure"" which was later revealed to actually be due to the fact the pilot was too old to legally fly the aircraft and had to land urgently to avoid this coming to light. Then, we are treated absolutely horribly, given zero information or support, and not told when we'll be able to get home. For this horrific experience I was given a $125 voucher! When I was entitled to a full refund and the voucher did not work. When I tried to use it to book a flight (which I was doing through American Airlines so I could use the voucher - I would never willingly fly with this despicable airline again) I was told the voucher was invalid. I purchased the flight with my own money and contacted customer service requesting to be reimbursed for the value of the voucher, and explained the situation - only to be treated abhorrently, my request refused with no alternate care or solution provided, and then simply ignored when I tried to find another remedy. The customer service AND flights themselves with this airline are the worst I've experienced."
91,"Not Verified |  Flight to Chicago delayed due to weather - then they boarded us, then made us deboard only to board us again 15 minutes later and then made us sit at the gate for an extra 45 minutes which caused us to miss our connection to Bozeman. While standing in line after deboarding, they gate agents were very rude to passengers trying to get on different flights in order to not miss their connections. Arrived in Chicago and stood in line for over 2 hours while also on hold with customer service to be told the earliest we could get to Bozeman was in 2 days. The closest we could get was to Salt Lake City in which case we had to buy additional tickets from Salt Lake to Bozeman for $400 each and we still lost a day of travel. We lost one day of work and the tickets on Delta (total $1800 loss) just to get back in time to not lose more $$. They did refund the ticket from Chicago to Bozeman ($89 each) and gave us a $50 travel credit. Doesn't really help with the $1200 we had to shell out just to get home."
92,"✅ Trip Verified |   Worst flight experience ever. I've traveled a lot for business and vacation, so I know to expect minor annoyances that can occur like lost baggage and even storm delays however what shows me an airlines quality is their consideration to passengers in how they handle these things. American Airlines completely failed on all levels of customer service, good judgment and common sense on our last trip from PGV to MCO. Both our departing and returning flights connected in Charlotte airport and that is where American had problems both coming and going. Our flight down to Orlando was delayed in Charlotte for over an hour and caused us to miss dinner plans. Not a big deal, just annoying. But on our flight home from Tampa, we were again delayed in Charlotte. This time, we were delayed over an hour and half in the CLT terminal, gate agents were extremely rude and sitting with us were a few American Airline pilots also complaining about how they never allow their family to fly though Charlotte because of the frequent delays. Not a good sign when their own pilots are complaining about their experience with the airline. We boarded the plane despite storms on the radar and then they delayed us again in the plane for another 2.5-3 hours. I lost track of how many delays were extended in the plane because they just kept us there with little communication other than another delay. It would have been more comfortable to have left us in the terminal where we had food and AC. Yes, on the plane, there is WARM air coming from the vents that does little to cool off the plane. Also, only cookies to eat and I'm gluten free so I wasn't able to eat any dinner. To top it off, the baggage handlers left our luggage in pile on the tarmac in the pouring rain for hours with no protection, so our bag was soaked through and the clothing contents needed dry cleaning. Trying to make a complaint or request compensation with American is another nightmare. I was bounced from several different departments, directed to emails and online forms to fill out because you can't call them to ask for cash refunds. Then i was offered an insulting credit of miles and $50 trip credit for future travel with them. What makes them think I want to spend more money on travel with them in the future to use a credit?? I dont trust them to make good decisions in the passengers best interest or to even treat us with consideration. Their pilots, gate agents, baggage handlers were all disrespectful and rude. Our flight experience was awful and customer service just avoided a resolution or refund. I could have flown with a cheerer airline to get this low quality experience and paid half of what I paid American. I will never fly an American flight ever again. Not only did they cost us time on our trip, leave us uncomfortable and hungry but they also added further work for me after the trip with taking clothes to dry cleaning and wasting more of my time with phone calls and forms to file complaints which have been basically ignored or auto replied. Never again."
93,"✅ Trip Verified |   American Airlines is easily the worst major domestic airline in the US. Well over 50% of flights I've taken the last 3 years have been delayed. On two separate occasions I have had to reschedule international flights because the domestic 1st leg was delayed and I could not make the scheduled connection, resulting in losing half a day or more of hard-earned time on the ground at our destination. AA has offered no explanation or compensation in any case. I will do everything in my power to avoid ever flying AA again."
94,"Not Verified | I've been Executive Platinum on AA for 15+ years. Without a doubt this is the worst service I've had on any flight, especially on an international business class flight, in 30 years. Old, grumpy flight attendants. Never smile, never engage. Always slow. Asking for a glass of water would take 3 attempts and 20 minutes before you got anything. This is international business class! (there's no first class on this plane, this is as good as it gets). They rush out a mediocre meal at the beginning of the flight then go hide away for 6 hours. Literally not a single attendant moved through the seats for 6 hours. I had to go find someone for a glass of water. Unbelievably bad. Disappointing. I've held onto this since of loyalty to AA since I was a kid. We used to fly Piedmont Airlines all the time, which became USAir, not American. These people have stripped everything of ANY value out of what used to be a wonderful airline. Oh, and we were 6 hours late on the outbound flight and 2 hours late on the return. All airline issues, not weather. Avoid at ALL COSTS! If you still have AA status, as I do, leverage it to buy a ticket directly with BA. American is a joke and has no place whatsoever competing against real global airlines on these international route. Only thing AA is good for is that upgrade from Charlotte to Akron Ohio, or whereeverthehell they fly; but don't waste your money on AA for real routes."
95,"Not Verified | I have never had to resort to posting to social media, but after the terrible experience I have had with @Americanairlinescustomerservice, I am hoping this will help engage them and make people aware of what they may be in for if they ever fly #AmericanAirlines. We had left for vacation overseas and on day 2 our 6 year old daughter had a life threatening emergency that required immediate surgery. We dropped everything and arranged to change our return flight home from days in the future to within a few hours. Making this change AA then charged us an additional $2,300 dollars just to make this change! We contacted customer service and were told this was due to flight being full. We get in the plane and it was maybe at 60% capacity- so first lie. Once we got home and ensure our daughter was safe after surgery, we reached out to customer service to see if they would be willing to reimburse us the additional $2,300 and not for the original cost of the pre-paid flights. Since then it has been over 90 days. They have purposely bounced us around, spelled our last name incorrect, asked for documents and then never acknowledged they were received and blatantly ignored all follow-up attempts. We then just simply asked for a statement that we were not reimbursed for original pre-paid flight to complete our travelers insurance claim through a separate company and they have not provided. This has been the worst experience we have ever had and never imagined that following the awful scare with our daughter, we would be dragged through the mud by American Airlines."
96,"✅ Trip Verified |   I don't know if this site published the ticket itself, but on the outbound and inbound flights, there are little airplane images. However they booked me on a bus! Their first several responses were essentially ""sorry you should have known"". The last response was ""you can cancel your trip and we'll review if we give you a refund"". Again ... a bus. I booked on their website AA.com. This feels like a scam."
97,"Not Verified |  Recently took a birthday trip to San Antonio. Me and my partner worked half the day at our job to ensure we didn't miss out 5 pm flight just to be delayed almost 3 hours on top of that we ended up in Dallas without another flight till the morning. We asked about getting refunded if we got a rental car and drove the rest of the way and the girls at the airport said they should be able to fully refund you so we paid for a rental that was almost $300 & arrived in San Antonio about 5 AM ( When we should have originally landed around 9 pm)we paid for a night of the hotel that we didn't even spend the night in then tried to put our claim through hoping to get the rental reimbursed at least but they ended up only giving us 50$ airline credit and 50$ back on each ticket from Dallas to San Antonio so all together about 150 back half of what we spent on the rental and our hotel we missed out a night on that money was lost which was 282 a night so including half a days of being paid at our job and spending money on a rental we lost out on well over 600$. I have been on multiple airlines, and this is by far the worst, spirit was even better than this."
98,"✅ Trip Verified |   American Airlines (AA) lost our bags for 5 days/four nights traveling from Cincinnati to Quebec via Charlotte. We had AirTags so we could tell the bags made it to Charlotte, NC but AA decided to send them to Chicago before routing them to us in Quebec. Inexcusable. We had to buy underwear and clothes (not to mention personal hygiene products for 2 people). Probably set us back $200. But that’s not even the WORST aspect. Four days later, we left Quebec and were headed to Top Sail, NC (via Charlotte) for a beach week but you lost both bags a SECOND TIME! We had to buy all new personal hygiene stuff because the baggage guy in Wilmington was out of any emergency hygiene packages (and he could have cared less about us and our missing bags.) He needs training since he was extremely rude to us. Typical Gen-Zer who was disappointed that he had to work at all and we added to his workload by filing our 2nd LOST BAGS FORM IN FOUR DAYS! We predicted that AA would cancel our Charlotte flight to CVG (since we noticed it was only half full). And we were right. You managed to delay and eventually cancel our flight and we had to rebook for 4 hours later. thanks for making a long day even longer. But that's really not the worst part. You rebooked us in the last row middle seat and the next to last row middle seat. So those cushy up-front seats that we paid extra for evaporated and I couldn't even lean my seat back. We rather despise your airline now. The lost bag guy in Quebec’s airport deserves a shout-out since he was empathetic and kind to us. Not that it helped. We travel internationally a lot but American is now off the list for local & international travel. "
99,"Not Verified |   Avoid this Airline The turnaround times for the planes are too short. The incoming plane just lands when you should already boarding. Then the pilots drag their feet with all different excuses to delay the flights even more. For example filling out a logbook for 30 min, then having a mechanic look at a seat with no issue. Knowing that if they continue this for a little bit there will be a ground stop probably issued since there is some weather coming from the south and they will go north. And as predicted after the hour in the plane passed the ground stop was issued and we had to sit for another 2 hours in the plane. Final end from this was that they had us deplaned and the pilots walked by with a smile since the did not have to fly on a holiday. Now no other flights are available for the next 2 days. No support from the Airline for lodging or Taxi. Getting in contact with customers relationship their answer is your own fault to fly with us. I was flying quite a bit in my life but American Airlines is one of the worst. "
100,"✅ Trip Verified | We flew from Augusta, GA to Charlotte NC with no problems. In Charlotte, our flight was cancelled to Vancouver. The reason given was weather. Not delayed, cancelled. I called AA and was told they could put us on a flight to Vancouver 2 days later. We stood in line for airport customer service for 2 hours. They booked us on a flight to Chicago, then Seattle, then Vancouver. With delays at all airports, we arrived in Vancouver 17 hours late. Our luggage did not arrive with us in Vancouver. We pre-paid for a hotel room in Vancouver, so that money is lost. Our luggage arrived at the hotel the next day (2 days after we should have arrived in Vancouver). When we opened our luggage the contents were wet and some of the clothes were stained. I do not recommend anyone flying AA. We missed an entire day of our vacation because of cancellations and delays."
101,✅ Trip Verified |   I was very upset when they canceled my flight due to mechanical errors however looking back I do feel it was handled to the best of the airlines ability. They gave frequent updates and then re routed me automatically without having to stand in line. I got upgraded with my gold card and it was overall a pleasant flight. The food was great and so was customer service.
102,"Not Verified |  American airlines is the worst airline I have experienced. We sat on the tarmac for 3 hours since the airline lost its flight plan. When we got to Miami we missed our connection and it took nearly 3 hours for us to get our hotel and vouchers. The $12 vouchers, only vaid at the airport and hotel, could not pay for a single meal in full. They would not provide cash and originally rebooted me on a flight with a 10 hour layover in Jacksonville the next day. They had multiple direct flights listed online for purchase to DC but since they purposely overbook refused to allow us to rebook those flights. This airline is worse than spirit and frontier. I will never fly this airline again."
103,"✅ Trip Verified |   I am never flying with American Airlines ever again. They ruined my birthday trip. I had a flight with a layover in Charlotte. They said my flight was cancelled due to “weather”. However there were 2 other back to back Charlotte flights around the same time as my flight and they got to go. Additionally, I know people who live in Charlotte and they confirmed with me today that there were no weather issues. So their excuse was just weather. They rebooked my flight for tomorrow, however I lost a night at my airbnb and had to pay for 2 Ubers out of my own pocket. I emailed their customer relations team and they sent me this unempathetic canned email. This is really pathetic on their end. To top it all off I’m missed my own birthday celebration. You should never use this airline."
104,"✅ Trip Verified |   Had a business trip to Orlando. on 28th 3 hour delay out out CLT because they said the plane was too hot. external AC wasn't working. they didn't switch out planes until 3 hours later. On return on 29th, delays on MCO flight since plane arrived to MCO later then toothy connection so while in flight thru churned my flight. I was able to get on the last flight scheduled out to RIC them that was canceled since they had no pilots for a Scheduled flight. Moved it to 5am so no hotel, had to stay in the terminal. I have been flying American since before covid, due to routes I had to fly. Since covid all service has declined. always late, customer service even with platinum plus you wait excessively. I'm going back to Delta."
105,"✅ Trip Verified | My son recently flew American for a hockey tournament from VA with a connection to Charlotte and a final destination to Ft. Lauderdale. He was traveling alone with his hockey equipment (bag with gear and hockey sticks all properly packed). He arrived around 1 pm in FLL and immediately checked his gear. All outside bags looked in tack. He briefly checked his sticks (bottom to center) that were in separate travel bags and all looked good but never took them completely out of the bag to fully inspect the inside content. Again the outside of the bag looked fine. That evening (7 PM) as we were preparing to go to the rink and he was getting his gear together he wanted to retape his sticks (3 of them) and when he removed them from the bag all three sticks were broken on the top of the sticks. We immediately called the customer service line and waited well over an hour for a call back only to be then pushed to another representative and have to wait another 45 minutes to speak to someone. At this point, it was well over 11 pm when the customer service representative told us we had to return to the airport so baggage claim could assess the damage. We had 24 hours to file our claim at this point in the evening we only had about an hour to return to the airport and were exhausted from travel and the stress of the damage. So we woke up the next morning at 5:45 am to travel back to the airport. We were at the office at 6:30 am when they opened and no one was there. Waited about 30 minutes for someone to finally arrive and was the least bit helpful or caring. She had us scan a QR code and fill out our claim. This claim only allowed us to take (1) picture which did not give a full assessment of the damage made to all three of his sticks. Let us note that two of the sticks were custom and the total value of all three is about $1,000! After filing the claim the rep at the airport sent us on our way and said we had to wait for a response. We were greeted with a denied claim a few hours later. I again called the customer service line to see if I could get further details as to why this was denied. They broke the sticks in transit and were little to NO HELP at all but to no avail to get a human on the line to assist us let alone an email where we could atleast reach out to someone else. We also reached out to customer service via ""X"" (Twitter) and we got the same customer service line and resent all the pictures of the damage to later get a message via DM that the claim was also denied. I will never fly American Airlines again and strongly suggest anyone traveling with sports equipment or equipment of significant value to stay clear from this airline! I will make sure that I write reviews everywhere possible to save someone the headache and the nightmare of the lack of Customer Service American provides and without helping and finding resolution to a problem they created."
106,"✅ Trip Verified | I have flown AA premium economy several times and never experienced an issue. This flight was delayed for almost 3 hours, an initial 6:40 p departure, pulled back from the gate at 8:55 p. The PE cabin crew came through slinging the trays, the beverage cart serving warm, very bad white wine. Only portion of the meal edible was the salad and desert. A glob of cold white rice with mysterious chicken swimming in a sauce of dubious heritage. No further crew contact until an arm reached over my back, grabbed the try and I tried to get his attention to order a cocktail. He sort of nodded and kept going. I finally saw the attendant who had managed the beverage cart and asked her for a cocktail. The response, I’ll see what I can do, 5 minutes later an announcement indicated no further service was to provided in PE or E. Lights out. I managed to find a biz class attendant who immediately served the cocktail. Tried to watch a movie, headphone's by AA only provided static. Breakfast came, the same beverage cart attendant came through and I asked her for a Bloody Mary. Was told she would “see about it”. Never saw her again. I did contact AA and they provided 10,000 miles. I am Platinum and did expect a bit more, this flight had no business offering PE when it would have been poor performance in regular economy. Perhaps it’s just the CLT crew, but it was obvious they didn’t care, and couldn’t wait to get rid of use. I’m flying back from London tomorrow, non stop to Miami and if this low level of service continues, then goodbye AA."
107,"Not Verified |  I flew to Memphis without much of a hitch 30 minute delay on runway from Myrtle, but my return left me boarding on time in Memphis and had to check my carry on due to no space. We were in air for approx 45 min and they announced most of connecting flights were delayed or cancelled, mine being one delayed for 9 hours leaving me without my carryon luggage with my meds I have to take at 7am and my rescue inhaler if I would have needed it. I had a important meeting at 8 am with no way to reschedule so I opted to get a rental car and drive home to have meds and make meeting. So I paid 560.00 for this flight and 250.00 in rental car and was given a 86.00 credit. I fly regularly and trust me will never fly with American again. People at gate and customer service were rude and careless of my situation along with many other people that missed connecting flights and canceled flights due to their being late into Charlotte."
108,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight to Tulum delayed hours because the plane had to offload gas. We sat in the planes on the tarmac while waiting. Flight back to DFW was delayed several times, then cancelled. Re booked on flight the next day. American Airlines did not compensate or reimburse for hotel room, taxi transfers or meals. Customer Relations is just the opposite. No relations. There is not a phone number to call, only email address. They respond by deflecting, putting off and finally just ignoring, Horrible customer service, Left hundreds of passengers stranded for over 24 hours in a foreign country."
109,"Not Verified |   Flying from Providence to Charlotte, started with a mechanical issue that then turned into a weather delay. Sat on the plane for 2 hours and 59 minutes before they put us in the air. Because of this delay I was going to miss my connection so they changed it for me. With doing that they changed me from landing in Sarasota to Tampa without a notice or thought. When I got to Charlotte they had sent me the wrong boarding pass and would not let me on the flight that they had sent me in an email that was leaving right away. Instead the 2 very rude attendants said I could not get in the plane because there was no time yet they let 2 people that were also on my flight into the plane. The plane was there the door was open and they would not let me on it or help in anyway. They then said that another flight was boarding in 20 minutes so they would get me on that one which was also a lie, because she knew that that flight was also already delayed 2 hours. When I went to the American Airlines information desk to see what happened, he literally shrugged me off as well and said nothing they could do because they were blaming the delay on weather. Took zero responsibility for anything and did not care at all. The last 6 flights that I have taken, all within this month on American Airlines, every single one has been delayed. Not a care in the world for their customers just their money."
110,"Not Verified |  American Airlines is bottom of the barrel. Of 14 flight legs in the past 2 years, 6 have made it on time, and 5 have been 3 hour plus delays. They destroyed my surfboards and lost my luggage as well. They used to be a midgrade airline, but they have gone downhill in the past 2 years. Do not use AA."
111,"✅ Trip Verified | Horrible customer service at the Albany airport. Our mobile tickets were invalid at the security check and they sent us to the ticket counter. The agent said she was the only one there and would not reprint boarding passes as she was only checking in bags. We arrived 2.5 hours before flight departure and after waiting an hour for security check then another 30 min at the ticket counter, the agent refused to print boarding passes and refused to rebook us. Took us another hour on the phone to find out there were no available flights today so we got a rental car and are now driving 12 hours back to Ky. Will never fly to or from this airport again. Will never book American Airlines again."
112,"Not Verified | Out of 4 flights, 3 delayed, luggage delayed 7 hours. The delay into DFW caused a missed connection and overnight stay. No customer service from American. They did offer a hotel stay at the Motel 6 or Super 8, no thank you. (Do you think they put there crew in those hotels?) There was no compensation for all these delays. My problem is not with the delays, I know that happens. My problem is with the poor customer service. I will reluctantly be going back to Delta."
113,"✅ Trip Verified | WORST AIRLINE EVER. I have a credit card with American but I’m DEFINITELY canceling it because today was the last straw. I arrived with my family at our destination at 11:40. Now we have a cruise planned that we have to be there by 2 for our check in time. It is 1:44 when I am writing this. American has our bags hostage and gets mad at its  customers for asking where the heck our bags are. American please notify your customer about the status of baggage because when you don’t, then you create panic and can’t get mad at people for questioning what happened to their stuff especially when the customers pay for their baggage. If I could give a zero star review I would. American is literally like Spirit Airlines, but Spirit is starting to get a little better and they are cheaper."
114,Not Verified |  It was the worst flight I ever experienced in my life. The crew were Very impolite and messy.  I asked for the ear set and they throw the package in my face. They didn't provide any travel kit for the 14 hours flight. The food was not fresh and awful taste. There were no service during the flight just one dinner that I couldn't even looked at it. I asked one of the crew to change my seat to the rows that had 3 empty ones but their interactions were very rude and without any empathy. The empty seats remained empty while I had a terrible back pain. I don't recommend American Airlines to my friends and family.
115,Not Verified | I just wanted to give a great shout out to crew on flight 777 Aug 15. We were running late for our flight! We got on plane because the pilot waited a few seconds! He is the Best! We had the best crew that was so loving and caring! We could only ever hope that you are the crew in the future! Yall are so great at your jobs! Much appreciation!
116,"✅ Trip Verified |   I've had a really bad experience with AA. They damaged my backpack and I lost almost all my clothes and laptop accessories. I bought new items and sent a claim with the new receipts hoping to get a refund for a total of almost 1500$ (more than 20 items). They told me I had to provide the receipts of the missing items, not the one for the items bought as a replacement. I spent hours trying to find them and sent those I could find. Then they said they could only give me a refund for shoes that I bought after my things were lost, using one of the new receipts. I thought this was a joke. I asked if it was the same person who was treating the claim as obviously there were contradictory information. We have then exchanged emails for weeks and they gave me different excuses / reasons that didn't make any sense. At this point I understood they were trying to discourage me from pursuing my claim. I asked to be put in contact with another employee or the manager but they never answered. When I understood I would never get the refund, I had to cancel my trip to Guatemala because I didn't have the budget to continue my travel. Do you have any tips or contact that could help me with my claim?  Any help or advice would be appreciated. Many thanks!"
117,"Not Verified | Had too many arrangements that were cancelled because of their delay. I tried to talk to them to get voucher and they don’t give vouchers except for connected flights. Why do I have to cover their mistakes? It is annoying when a company does a mistake and you have to fix their issue, while it is their problem."
118,✅ Trip Verified | Worst Customer service ever 1.departing flight. Pilot rejected plane because inside temp of plane was 109 (his words). Plane was sitting and AA forgot to use the aux power to support the planes ac Resulting in hours delay because of AA employee mistake. NOT WEATHER OR MECHANICAL. Asked AA for some points but got nothing 2. Return flight paid for 2 first class tickets (a upgrade for us and our vacation) and had to fly in coach. Not a big deal but I paid for the first class tickets took multiple email and phone calls finally got reimbursed for a partially $150. The ticket upgrade was $400 each when I booked What a bunch of trash. I’m disputing my charge on my AA credit card and will be closing out account USE ANOTHER AIRLINE if you care about customer service
119,"✅ Trip Verified | Incompetent and rude staff. Since May we've had nothing but problems flying with this Airline. If it is not cancelled flights, it is vouchers not being given to all customers. The last event in August 11th was our 2nd luggage never made it up the belt. Apparently one of their employees wanted to steal it until they realized there was nothing but door handles and shoes in it. We went to put a claim and the supervisor on the 1p.m. shift name Ileana screamed that she wouldn't be putting bag claims to do the QR code. This was impossible to do on the site and I've been over 9 days trying to get someone to help. Now they called to say they will send my luggage to Texas. Useless, rude, overprices thieves. "
120,"✅ Trip Verified |   I am writing to formally express my deep dissatisfaction with the recent experience my family and I had with American Airlines. We were booked on a flight from Miami to JFK Airport that was unexpectedly canceled due to weather conditions. While I understand that weather-related cancellations are sometimes unavoidable, the handling of the situation was unacceptable. After the cancellation, my wife, our two young children (ages 3 and 5), and I were left stranded in Miami. We spent an agonizing six hours in line just to speak to a representative, only to be told that the next available flight was three days later. I explained to your staff that I would lose my job if I could not return home on time, but no alternative solutions were offered. Given the urgency of our situation, I decided to rent a car and drive from Miami to New York. However, when I attempted to retrieve our luggage, I was informed that it had already been sent on another flight to JFK. This was incredibly frustrating, as it clearly demonstrated that there were flights departing for JFK, yet we were not accommodated on any of them. This entire ordeal has caused significant stress and inconvenience for my family, not to mention the financial burden of staying in Miami for an additional three days and the cost of a rental car. I am also concerned about the potential impact on my employment due to the delay. Given the circumstances, I kindly request a full explanation of why we were not offered an alternative flight sooner, despite the fact that our luggage was sent to JFK. Additionally, I am seeking compensation for the additional expenses we incurred as a result of this situation, including the cost of the rental car and any other associated costs. I have been a loyal customer of American Airlines, but this experience has left me questioning my choice of airline. I hope that you will take this complaint seriously and provide a satisfactory resolution."
121,"✅ Trip Verified |   My husband and I are traveling on vacation and we have a very small window to do this; between his schooling and my job. We flew out on Sunday 11 August 2024. Originally we were delayed do to weather. This is acceptable. Nothing could be done because safety is a priority. However, when we were delayed three times at our next stop because, they decided to do some repairs on the plane instead of finding one that was already ready to go. Finally they decided to try and find another plane. This is after three hours of waiting. This is unacceptable. We ended up having to go and speak with an airline employee because everything was simply too chaotic due to all of the delays. We ended up being at one airport for five hours. Mind you this had nothing to do with weather. Every single flight with American Airlines has been delayed. Every connecting flight. HOURS behind schedule. Now here we are 18 August 2024, trying to get back home from vacation before my husband has to go back to school first thing 19 August 2024. First flight out and we are over an hour behind schedule. I can honestly say that I don’t fly a lot. I don’t enjoy it. Now I feel resolved to not fly American Airlines unless I have absolutely no other choice. This review has nothing to do with the pilots or the crew who simply come in and do their job. This has to do with the top of American Airlines . You should not only be keeping the airplanes safe for staff and passengers but you should have extra planes on the side in case one or two planes need repairs; this way the passengers are immediately being loaded and flown to the correct destination. Passengers would even pay extra money for their tickets if they knew they could count on that airline to deliver them in a timely manner. I cannot imagine the kind of roller coaster it would be for families who have autistic children or other special needs. "
122,"Not Verified |  We took 9 people to Las Angeles on vacation. Our departure was delayed over an hour in LAX due to ""Maintenance"", therefore we missed our connection in Chicago. The American Airlines rep at the counter in Chicago gave us the only option she had, which was wait 2 days and fly out on Monday. We couldn't do that without a few of use losing our jobs for not showing up the next couple days. She then told us that since this was due to a ""maintenance"" issue and not an act of God, and solely the fault of American Airlines, the cost would be reimbursed - just keep receipts for rental and fuel. So we rented 2 vehicles, drove 5 hours and got back just before my wife had to be at work. After a dozen emails with American Airlines Customer Relations Dept (and that's a joke), I was told that ground travel is not reimbursed due to their policy and therefor their rep must not have said that and therefore I must be lying to them. And of course, I got the emails telling me how they value our business, they understand our concerns, they want to gain our trust, they earn our business. Suggestion - if this happens to you, get the Rep to write it down and sign it.  They hope that American Airlines doesn't quote some other obscure policy and deny your claim anyway. I'm out just over $1,000 and they honestly really don't care. I think they need to take American out of their name as this is not how Americans act. Fly any other airline. "
123,Not Verified | Cancelled our flight with 1hr notice at 11pm. Weather affecting the inbound flight from New York apparently but I checked and weather was great all day. Next available flight was 15hrs later. No compensation whatsoever. The biggest airline in the US but can't charter another plane. Funny that Alaska airlines did just that a week ago when their inbound flight was weather delayed. The cold as stone replies from staff said they were well used to this shocking customer service. There's loads of others to choose from. Avoid these CLOWNS! I certainly will. Awful.
124,"✅ Trip Verified | I traveled with 4 kids total 5 tickets going to AMM.. on the counter served by a mean agent. We have only two luggage’s only for 5 tickets not even carry on baggage, one bag has 53 pounds, she gave us a very hard time, we almost missed our flight, it took more than 30 minutes while creating the boarding passes where as at the next counter people are moving and seeing bags 53, 54,55 pounds and people moving on. We travel two to three times every year, never had worse than today’s experience with Doris and Raja in DCA airport."
125,"✅ Trip Verified | Four of us were traveling under my husband's AA status due to his status. We had 6 bags with us traveling back from SEA-TAC to CLT from a cruise. One bag was left in SEA-TAC and we don't have any idea why. When notifying AA baggage office in CLT, we are told to fill out this LOST baggage claim online. A link was provided. No where in the required information are you given an option of picking it up at the airport or having it delivered. At submission of the information, it just states ""the bag will be delivered"". You are provided a file # to reference and it has this picture of status bar of where your luggage is once it has been found. I got one confirmation email of the submission but nothing else. My husband is notified this morning that the bag is at CLT. I didn't get a single update. No ""we found your bag"", ""bag is enroute"", ""bag has landed"", ""bag is out for delivery""... NOTHING. When I go to my initial email with the link to check status, it immediately goes to a webpage where it says my claim has been closed. I don't have my luggage, so how can the claim be closed. My husband is flying the next morning so we go to baggage claim to get my luggage. They tell him it has to be delivered because that is what we asked for. No we didn't. There was no option for delivery or pick up. So now AA is going to give it to a 3rd party company to deliver my bag and possibly run into another theft situation from CLT. This is the most unprofessional and a level of incompetence I have not run into in a long time. To boot, I can't even get anyone on the phone to voice my issues. I have to rely on chat and email complaints. This is a failure to simply do your job. They can't even get a claim submission completed properly and keep someone informed. How hard is it???"
126,"✅ Trip Verified |   Terrible customer service. Staff at gate 42A at 10am is extremely rude, talking to people as if there were not human beings. I notice that this is the type of service American Airlines is providing across the board here. It a shame how at one point had great service but choose to be the nasty and rude not worth the dime type of company."
127,"Not Verified | Horrible Experience with American Airlines – Worst Customer Service Ever! I arrived at the airport an hour and a half before my flight, expecting a smooth check-in process. Unfortunately, the kiosk informed me that it was too late to check a bag, so I had to wait in line. There were only 7 people ahead of me, but with just 2 agents working at the counter, it took an excruciating hour to get through. As the line barely moved, I noticed a team member standing by, not assisting anyone. I felt comfortable approaching her because I had seen her help another woman who was in a similar situation by putting her in a wheelchair and ensuring she made it through security in time to catch her flight. I politely asked if she could help us check our bag since our flight was now only 20 minutes away. Instead of offering assistance, she screamed in my face, telling me I didn’t know her situation. I calmly explained that she didn’t know mine either, and I was simply asking for help. As I walked away, she continued to yell at me. By the time we reached the counter, our plane had already left. It took just 3 minutes for the agent to check our bag, but it was too late. We had to rebook on a new flight, all because of the inefficiency and shocking lack of customer service. I’ve never experienced anything like this with any other airline, and I’ll be avoiding American Airlines in the future."
128,✅ Trip Verified |   This airline is a logistical nightmare. We booked from Mazatlan to MSP which gave us a layover of barely over an hour. They forced me to gate check but there was still plenty of open space. Only those who spoke Spanish managed to get these leftover spaces. Then we had the mad dash to catch our connection. You'd think an airline would know how much time to leave. Never again.
129,"Not Verified |   Went to Cancun for my sister's birthday and American Airlines is awful, I will never fly with them again. Rreated rudely by customer service in the airport and rude by customer service on the phone telling me all about their policies with zero empathy and absolutely no willingness to be of assistance. It was a disgrace, un organized, rude workers, flight delayed multiple times. AA customer service is a joke, it's basically non existent. Planes are small and cramped. As far as I can tell there is no redeaming qualities at this point. Yes I am at the airport waiting for a delayed flight that they refuse to reimburse me for because I haven't been inconvenience for a whole 24 hours yet."
130,"Not Verified |  Departing flight was 8 hours late. This jammed up the connections. Then, the next connection was 30 minutes late, which didn't cause a problem because the next flight was 3 hours late. They are 3 for 3 with late flights. I will not be flying American again unless it is an emergency. Cancelling the credit card since I won't be a returning American customer. My recommendation is to pay a little more and fly with a dependable airline. American sucks. None of the delays were weather related."
131,"Not Verified | After having a flight booked for 6 months American Airlines changed the flight, without my consent, to the day before. This will cost an additional $350 in hotel/travel expenses if I can even get a room. One representative blamed the credit card company, the other stated that they don't give credit for their mistakes. She told us to take it or leave it. I asked to fly out a day earlier to make up for the initial costs. She said no and they would cancel the trip. Completely unacceptable. Scammers have more morals. This is the most untrustworthy, dishonest, airline I have ever ""done business"" with. I would HIGHLY suggest that anyone fly ANY airline other than American! Below is the letter they send out - Thank you for contacting American Airlines Customer Relations. Please accept my sincere apologies for the experience you've described. We're committed to prioritizing our customers in everything we do, and your feedback highlights this commitment. Your valuable insights will be made available to our leadership team to explore necessary improvements and deliver the world-class customer experience you expect from us. I appreciate your willingness to share your feedback with us. From everyone at American Airlines, thank you for choosing to fly with us. We look forward to the opportunity to welcome you on board again soon. Date of experience: August 13, 2024."
132,"Not Verified |  I will never fly with this airline again, it was a nightmare. They can’t have honesty with the customer, they put my family in stand by situation without let me know. When I was in Miami, customer representative told me I have to wait next day and they will not pay a hotel room, I have to sleep in the gate with my kids. They put me in Another stand by list the next day this people can careless rude customer service not worthy and don’t even expect any tickets refund."
133,"Not Verified | I recently had the worst experience with AA at the Newark Airport. I complained and requested for at least travel credit as I lost over $1100 as we missed our flight. We even checked in, had our boarding passes and seats assigned, we encountered a series of unfortunate events that left us feeling frustrated and emotionally distressed. Despite making prior communication with the gate agent, the airline departed from the gate before 2 p.m., causing us to miss our flight. My elderly dad got lost at the airport, didn't have his passport and security helped him and called me to come to the security check with his passpot as he left the gate and he speaks very little english! He was scared and panicked, TSA helped him quickly to get in, even though we were at the gate before 2 and my mom and sister were waiting there and let the agent know that we found our dad and requested to wait for 5 mnts. The gate agent was incredibly rude and dismissive, and she said she would not let us in as the boarding is done and gate was closed, and we have to wait as she was busy with other customers and insisted that we seek assistance at the ticket counter customer service. This lack of empathy and professionalism only added to our distress. Upon reaching the ticket counter at AA customer service, we were informed that nothing could be done and we have call customer service as they can not help with anything one agent even was so rude, said to us that they can't talk to us only can help if we have bags to check in. I almost cried and reached out to several agent over the phone, the only agent was helpful was ANGELO through chat service. I have requested to give some compensation as I am a AA advantage member. They said they can only give me 7500 points and I spent in total $1151.92. How this is a good customer service and how come a member can loose this much funds. I don't think I would ever reccommend AA to anyone."
134,"Not Verified |  Very average customer service. My spouse required a wheelchair which did not arrive as requested. Flight attendant napped during the flight. On the return gate attendants were unhelpful. Flight attendant, however, did an excellent job! I will not fly American again, unless there is no other choice."
135,"✅ Trip Verified | July 24 I traveled from Philadelphia to Doha Qatar and hate American Airlines. They were 5 hours late plus didn't give us a glass of water and we all were badly hungry. My daughter has to submit her assignment, I was ready to pay for wifi but system was off and my daughter was crying because she couldn't submit her assignment to get grades to university. My younger daughter was crying for food. Everyone was hungry but after 5 hours when flight take off they came to give us Tissue papers, then came to collect tissue papers then came to distribute wine and drinks. We were dying for food and requesting for at least cookies. They didn't compensate at all."
136,"✅ Trip Verified |   San Francisco to Dallas Fort Worth onboard their Airbus A321. Check-in was no-nonsense; all I needed was to print my bag tag and boarding pass, take my bags to a dedicated counter, show my ID, and I was off to my gate in no time. The flight was delayed by 20-ish minutes, but then we were soon on our way. They deployed their usual A321EOW with larger overhead bins, LED lighting, and Collins Meridian seats. While the cabin was comfortable and in good condition, it was rather dirty with lots of leftover trash behind, crumbs, gunk, and grime embedded in the carpet and seats. The seat was rich in contents, with charging ports and 2 literature storage items. It was pretty easy to recline too, and the legroom was decent. Once we took off, the IFE kicked in, and the Wi-Fi-based IFE was super speedy. It loaded most content without issues, and I had no trouble streaming YouTube content, texting friends and family, and accessing several sites. The cabin crews were a bit of a letdown; except for two, all of them looked tired, depressed, and unmotivated; one was even rude towards an old Cantonese-speaking grandma when she inadvertently opened her tray table before taking off. One of the crews who was friendly, who I presume was a Korean, admitted this by saying ""We are dying, actually"" - which I understand since it is not easy to work on a red-eye like this, however, I believe they could have been much friendlier and better at communicating; although I could feel their presence for the entire 2.5-hour flight. The landing was surprisingly early; 6 minutes ahead of schedule, and I didn't have to wait for long for my bags to arrive. Overall, despite the crews falling a bit short and the dirty cabin, it was still a pleasant red-eye flight; however, I believe American's level is higher than this, and this flight isn't the American that I know."
137,Not Verified |  We were notified that our flight was cancelled while flying the 4 hour 43 minute flight from LAX on 8/5/2024. It was rescheduled for the next day at three different times for our party of five. The times were not acceptable due to work schedule and prior commitments. We denied the flights. It was not mentioned in the email that our luggage would be rerouted to our final destination whether we kept the flight or cancelled it. That would have been valuable information and saved us 3 hours and alot of frustration When we reached the airport we were told our luggage would be put on ramp 18 in baggage claim. After waiting 2hours we were told to stand in line to claim our baggage. Another wait. Then we're told it was a 6-10 hour wait before we could get our luggage. Due to the cancellation we rented a car to take the 6 1/2 hour trip to get home. Another frustrating time finding the car and unexpected payment and we're told American Airlines doesn't reimburse for the extra cost and response that we most likely won't get reimbursed because we chose to cancel the flight not America air Another call or go online to check into it. Flights were being booked 3-5 days out. Then our group did the courtesy option to check our bag to help the airlines. We were told that our bags would be available at the door when we exited the plane. They weren't. Otherwise we would have kept them as carry ons. So after trying to get staff to answer luggage questions we were met with very rude staff personal at Philadelphia airline. A young lady obviously with a management position would walk down the aisle of probably 300-400 people looking for luggage or trying to check on status of rebooking flight and flip her hand at you and walk on. The gentleman that finally completed the process and finding that our luggage was on a plane to go to Syracuse NY on three separate flights the following day was very helpful even though he was taking alot of flack from frustrated customers. The management of the luggage was completely mishandled. Again we were told that America Airline was not at fault. This whole mess could be avoided if everyones luggage was put out in baggage claim for travelers to retrieve and have in their possession. There was several announcements that no flights were going out for the rest of the day. Several people shared they waited 10 plus hours for their luggage.  You leave your workers to take the irrate comments from customers Great staff morale. Time and personal property is precious to all people. I know you can't control weather situation and don't need airplanes in the air at these times. You can come up with alternative plans to compensate your customers. I have yet to get my luggage hoping to hear it's in Syracuse after midnight tonight and it is all safe. You are very quick to question and take items from our luggage while going through security but not accommodating at the end of a flight. Every situation should be accessed and plans in place to avoid this situation. I will share this experience with family and friends. It will be very questionable if I ever use the American Airlines again. I have definitely learned that I will never leave my luggage in the hands of an airline personal
138,Not Verified |   Flight was canceled after 3.5 hours. I hadn’t seen my two grandchildren in over two years because of my son’s divorce. They canceled it last minute and I can’t reschedule any flights to see my grandchildren for more than over twice or four times the price
139,"✅ Trip Verified |  We originally had a Delta flight from Dallas (DFW) to Atlanta and then to Amsterdam. Due to a delay, we were rebooked by Delta onto American Airlines Flight AA 80 from Dallas to London and then to Amsterdam. Upon arriving at the American Airlines desk at Gate D24, we presented our I-571 Refugee Travel Documents and the paperwork provided by Delta. However, the American Airlines personnel was unfamiliar with our travel documents. Despite explaining that Delta had no issues with our documents, she called her manager who dismissed our documents without even looking at the official Netherlands government website that confirmed we did not need a visa. She sent us back to Delta, causing significant stress and inconvenience. Delta personnel reassured us that our documents were valid and sent us back to American Airlines. We then found a helpful lady who assisted us, printed our boarding passes, and walked us to Gate D27. Despite this, a group of American Airlines staff, although willing to help, were intimidated by the manager, who had previously refused us. Eventually, after a stressful and humiliating ordeal, we were allowed to board the flight. Throughout our journey, we faced no issues with our travel documents in London or Amsterdam, confirming that our documents were indeed valid. It is deeply concerning that a major airline like American Airlines employs personnel who either lack the necessary knowledge or exhibit such blatant disregard for their responsibilities. "
140,"✅ Trip Verified |  We board the aircraft at 6:55 for a flight that was supposed to depart at 7:38, stayed in for two hours (until 9:40 and were told to deplane, back to the gate we were constantly told that we would board and depart within the hour, that went on until midnight, then they delayed the flight to 5am. At 4:35 we boarded again only to stay inside of the aircraft for another 2 1/2 hours. It was a very bad experience that almost cost me my job since I was supposed to be at work by 6:30 in the morning. But the worse thing was the lies they told us over and over. Then they refused me to give me a refund for all that stress. It a very bad company and I don’t recommend it to anyone, actually there were other passengers that were saying that the same thing happened to them before with this same airline. And I’m only giving one star because the site won’t let me give 0"
141,"Not Verified |   Had a great flight. American Airlines was the best. Smooth flying. Reasonable fares. Seats were comfortable. Had window seat at wing. The wife and i received a canned drink and cookies 45 mins after take off. Flight slightly less than 2 hours long, 1000 miles. Way better than driving."
142,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the single worst flying experience I have ever experienced!! This was my first time flying American Airlines and I will never be flying with them again! They lost $2,000 worth of my family’s luggage and then didn’t offer little to any help explaining what caused the problem or how we could rectify the problem. I will continuously advise family and friends to avoid American Airlines"
143,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was checked in the day prior to the flight and was bumped from an additional flight as a stand by passenger, in addition to not making this flight, and was offered to wait to hours on standby again. As I have photos of my arrival to the the desk with official documentation that it was prior to the 15 minutes of the gates closing. My name was not called over the intercom as other airlines did in the airport. Savannah is a small airport with 15 gates. I will never fly American Airlines again. Delta Airlines is a Georgia based company and I was bumped last week during the global technology issue and without even an email, complaint, or phone call, they offered financial compensation to me, without even asking. Delta Airlines has great customer service and is a model of exceptional customer service. I am not flying American Airlines, their customer service at every level from the local employees to the customer service department. I know it will not make a difference in the big picture. I will also make reviews, provide my personal insight, and continue to report my concerns to friends and family. Deeply disappointed."
144,"✅ Trip Verified |   This is the first time I had used American Airlines and I will not use them again. I landed in Dallas with an hour and a half layover. I checked my app to make sure no changes were made, saw the gate it said the plane would be. I went there and waited. While checking my app periodically to ensure no changes were made, I waited in the same spot for an almost an hour. When it was close to the departure time, (roughly 15 minutes) I went to an attending and asked about my flight to Idaho. He told me that the plane has just left. I asked him if it was announced over the PA system and he said yes. The gate I was at was E24b and the new gate the plane went to was E27. I didn't hear anything over the PA system about any changes or that they were boarding for my flight. I am not a frequent flyer, so I asked what I needed to do. He directed me to the American Airlines customer service desk. There were 2 staff, each at a computer, and a person was in front of me. Both staff decided to help him at the same time. Tears welled up in my eyes, I was already trying not to cry, because I knew the information I had and knew that I wasn't far away from the gate I thought I needed to be and the new gate and I felt like I had been highly mislead. Finally one of the staff calls me up to the counter asked me how she could help me, I tell her that I had missed my flight and in the middle of holding back tears and conversing with the staff, she completely ignored me and continued to have a conversation with the guy who was in front of me, cracking jokes and laughing as I waited patiently for her to bring her attention back to me. She then informed me that she could get me on the next flight (730pm) and as she typed in the information, she then told me that the flight was full and that I would be on standby. Again, not a frequent flyer, so I inquired what that meant. She explained and continued asking questions, which if I couldn't get on this flight that I would have to spend the night and the next flight wouldn't be until 7/27/24 at 7pm. I landed in Dallas at 930am 7/26/24. I got a boarding pass with standby. This was the most recent experience, but my first trip out to South Carolina, through American Airlines was also a hassle. The staff was very vague in their answers and very inattentive to me. From the other reviews I've seen, others seem to have similar experiences. Don't fly American Airlines. If I could I would give the overall rating a 0."
145,Not Verified |   We are loyal United customers and now I know why. Check in staff was not friendly. They made us check our carry on bags because they said they were full. When we got to our seats there were lots of open spaces for our bags in the overhead. If I wanted to check a bag I would have packed a bigger one. The flight was delayed and the bathrooms were not working.
146,"Not Verified |   It is sickening how customers are being treated by American Airlines on both travel days: 7.19.24 and 7.25.24. They have had nothing but unexplained delays on their end which has caused many passengers to miss their connecting flights. The rescheduled flights are then being delayed several hours at a time. After waiting in the customer service line for almost an hour the representative was rude and unhelpful. After reminding her of what a nightmare it has been for the last day of traveling with American Airlines she said ""We can give you $10 meal vouchers for each person in your party but not sure what you are going to find open."" How does this help in any type of way? We received $10 vouchers after waiting for 5 hours on an already rescheduled flight, vouchers we will not even be able to use. I understand that technical issues happen and also understand that safety should remain the priority. However, the customer service and lack of empathy received by the representatives at Charlotte, NC American Airlines on 7.25.24 is something we will never forget. So many other passengers I have been chatting with have horror stories with them as well. So incredibly disappointed with the service and experiences we had with American Airlines - never again will we ever fly with them. Also please note that on our initial travel day of 7.19.24 from Charlotte, NC to Turks and Caicos- we had the most unprofessional flight attendants."
147,"Not Verified |   I spent $1000 on return tickets from Boston to London. My first flight was more or less fine. Food was tasteless, but so it usually is with airlines. Where the American Airlines experience will really make your flying experience a nightmare is their ‘customer service’. You will spend hours on the phone speaking to people who are incapable of executing simple tasks and app which is hardly useable. I needed to change airports I was flying from Boston to New York - the app did not allow this to happen and when calling customer service little help was provided. Ultimately I cancelled under the understanding I would receive credits back. Somehow even this American Airlines failed in. I did not receive my points and spent countless hours screaming at clueless employees. It’s bewildering how a multi-billion dollar company can not execute simple tasks correctly. My advice: Don’t book American Airlines. Anyone is better than this."
148,"Not Verified |   This was the worst travel experience of my life. I experienced a bag delay on the way to my destination in Barcelona and had to wait 3 hours at the airport for my bag to arrive on the next flight. That's all fine, delays happen. However, upon returning home, I am informed that both of my checked suitcases (1 of which I was forced to check despite it being a small carry-on) were in London and I needed to fill out form to submit for luggage delay. It has now been 3 days without my luggage and without the tracker provided even informing me where my bag is. I called AA and spoke to a rep who said it looks like my second bag was never scanned? They could not give me a location or any updates whatsoever. This is not only confusing but incredibly disappointing and frustrating as I had valuables and gifts for friends and family from abroad. I will never fly with this airline again, first, last, and absolutely worst experience ever (not to mention the meal of pasta given on the aircraft contained a small pebble in the sauce- irrelevant to the bags being lost but gross and disgusting)."
149,Not Verified |   I’ve flown all my life and this is by far the best airline to fly. There was not one bump on this flight. Smoothest flight ever. Then my flight from LAX on was the same. Not one bump. These are the most experienced pilots to fly with.
150,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the worst experience flying with American Airlines. The Customer Service Team was not helpful at all. My first flight was delayed (not because of weather) by 3.5 Hours at Austin Bergstrom Airport and I got to know when I was waiting at the gate to Board. I headed to the Customer Service Desk without any directions or signs. I approached the desk and there was a huge line. It was not organised at all and only two agents were available at the desk to assist. They were ruthless. They gave me fewer options and none of the options allowed me to reach the final destination on time. No compensation was provided. On the other hand, I arrived late and had to take 3 stops and 4 flights which was tiring and uncomfortable for me. The worst part I paid an extra $100 for an additional bag and both bags were damaged. Please find attached the pictures of the bags. I will never recommend anyone to fly with American Airlines."
151,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines is irresponsible loading us on a plane knowing there’s weather issues and that this older plane couldn’t have cold air.  No drinks offered. No plan for weather issues. I stopped flying with them years ago and today reminded me why. You can’t take people’s money and time, toss them on a plane when they easily could have been in the airport, eating, staying cool, etc. It’s ridiculous that they charge us for seats and luggage on top of the flight, only to screw with us."
152,"✅ Trip Verified |  My 16 year old son was the sole ticket holder for this round trip. His first trip alone and a once-in-a-life-time opportunity to attend Honor Guard Academy through Civil Air Patrol for one week with a graduation ceremony and a trip to Arlington National Cemetery. He was the only C.A.P. cadet from his state to attend. A trip that he planned for 7 months, buying uniforms, taking virtual classes, tests, etc. He was recommended nationally for this opportunity. If only I had listened to the negative reviews of AA, we would have driven the 24 hours there instead. The first day his connecting flight was cancelled at 2am, 6 hrs before leaving so no time for making an alternate plan. Then a later flight left without us being told existed. Another flight was scheduled for the next day so he missed his first day at Honor Guard Academy. At 4 am we headed to the airport trying to catch an earlier flight after his rebooked flight was delayed again. While at the airport, my son checked his bags, went through security, sat at gate and watched his flight and every other possible flight to DFW be continuously changed, and delayed. He sat with all of his last hope and possibilities being slowly destroyed over the next few hours and with no time to make alternate plans or even drive to DFW for the connection 9 hours away. American Airlines said it was weather, then maintenance. We found out it was a lie. They didn't have a pilot or crew. They knew this but they didn't want to cancel and have to refund our money. If they had told us sooner, we could have drove or made other arrangements. The Honor Guard Academy ordered my son's Honor Guard uniform for graduation that he will never get to wear. He will not get to go, ever. Today he did not get out of bed and his two suitcases that took a week to pack full of hours-long polishing of boots, shoes, ironed and dry cleaned uniforms, ribbons earned, etc, etc now remain closed away, unpacked from his two suitcases standing silently in our living room. The trip that never left the airport. What American Airlines did to my son's hopes and dreams and months of hard work to make this trip possible has all been carelessly destroyed all for profit through deception. This is unforgivable and no refund can ever fix my son's broken heart."
153,"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst airline ever. I highly recommend NOT to book with them at all. They have the worst customer service. They lie and I can’t believe why they lie. There was a flight delay and I missed my connecting flight. I was told that my connecting flight will be held until I and other passengers arrive. We were later only for 15 minutes and our connecting flight was closed. When I called the customer service, they said no available flight and I had to wait 24 hours to get a new flight. That was not correct as I told them that I see other flights that leave earlier . They hanged up and it was so rude. They have no moral values at all. They deceive you. "
154,"✅ Trip Verified |  They cancelled my flight. No where at the airport gate, at the airport customer service, in cancellation emails, or in subsequent phone calls to the airline was a reason for the cancellation provided. I was supposed to land in New Orleans at 5pm, but arrived the next day at midnight. That is not the problem, though. The problem is they gave me zero assistance toward ground transportation, lodging, or food for my unplanned 36 extra hours away from home. I simply cannot afford this. This is an indecent way to treat human beings. They should cover my taxi rides away from and back to the airport, a hotel, and at least one meal. American Airlines can afford that; I cannot afford that."
155,"Not Verified |   We had a delayed flight from Portland to Dallas, which caused us to rebook a flight and wait in the Dallas airport for 10 hours. There were 4 of us who asked for a reimbursement and Courtney was so helpful at providing that for us. However, American Airlines would only provide $12 for the inconvenience! That’s not even enough to cover a side of fries at the airport! Very disappointed in American, but Courtney was very helpful!"
156,"✅ Trip Verified |  On July 14, 2024 at 9:00 PM , we had a rough start at the airport, starting with TSA, very unprofessional and rude. My mom has Alzheimer’s and she was in a wheelchair and one person was telling me to do one thing and then another person was yelling at me to do something else so they were not agreeing with each other. They get a 0 star. We were told to go to different gates; it’s hard when you have a mom with Alzheimer’s. We were at the airport from 2:00 pm until after 9:00 pm. But we had the best pilot which help lighten the experience that we had at the airport. He took off with such ease that you couldn’t feel that we were in the air. He spoke to us on the loudspeaker and was very clear and precise with his words. During our delay he kept us updated with everything that he learned from our delay.  He was very professional and his take off and landing was very good and he deserves to be commended for his expertise on his flying skills. Also our flight attendants were very nice and friendly and professional. Our pilot to Washington on flight AA 5442 was awful!"
157,"✅ Trip Verified | I had scheduled a flight for myself and my sons to visit a potential academy for them. I decided to treat them to first class since they had done so well. We arrived two hours before as instructed and the front counter didn't even open or show up for 45 minutes later only giving us a little over an hour to check in and get through security and get on our plane. Then even though it was showing on time the plane was not being loaded and it took till after we were supposed to leave to find out that our pilots were not here yet. We were told ""they are on their way"" multiple times till finally we were told the truth that they had timed out the night before. They were not going to be able to leave till later anyway. They knew this when we were able to check in at 3:45. they could have told us then. IF they would have, I could have then driven to Dallas myself and made my connecting flight which was on time and all would have been good. Instead, they made us late and because they wouldn't move the plane out of the way they made at least the next two flights also late because our plane was just sitting there. They could have even changed flight crews to let us use the next flight's crew and everything would have still been good. That is not the worst. They not only made us miss the connecting flight, but then we got bumped down in class and could not sit with my children on the flight. Then when contacting them about this, the only thing I wanted was to get refunded my charges for first class. Which per ticket would be $500 plus dollars per ticket. Instead, they are dragging their feet doing so and only refunded $158 per ticket, which is far less that reasonable and ridiculous to say that is the only difference between first and coach. Then I even sent from their own site the cost of first class and coach on same flight booked the same amount of time in advance and still no response. I am only asking for the right thing to be done. I was still able to get to my destination, but people plan flights according to their schedule and to be held up like this for no reason cost several people to miss some very important events they had planned. One example was a cruise a retired couple was taking. The ship left without them because they were not going to be able to get there till the next day because of this."
158,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very unprofessional staff. Showed up on time for flight but the kiosks were not working with one person at the ticket counter. Waiting roughly 4 minutes in line, a second employee showed up to check me in. She then said it was a minute too late to check in the bag. Then I went to the gate to check in my bag at the gate and they said it was too big when they still were checking in other bags and strollers in much larger luggage than I have. The very unhelpful guy went to see if I arrived before 2 pm she then when he stated a showed up before 2 pm, he claimed they stopped putting bags on the plane at 1:51pm (I arrived at 1:53 pm and was told at 1:57 pm that I was a minute late?). Told me I should have used the kiosk and I told him they were broken and continued to be unprofessional. I cannot wait to never fly American Airlines again"
159,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight time was changed at least 4 times for no apparent reason, weather is good. In addition the gate was changed also more than 4 times, taking me from one end of the the terminal to the other. Customer assistance employees very rude and worthless, they make you feel stupid for asking why is this happening, all they say this is normal, it happens all the time!!!"
160,"✅ Trip Verified | This airline is undeniable garbage. It’s sad because it’s clear that all of the issues come from money grabbing, corner-cutting greed of like the C-suite that has now led to an absolute disaster for customers. I found this website to rip them to shreds because it’s impossible to even leave feedback for them. They don’t allow a written documentation sent about topics they deem unworthy via their bizarre labyrinth of a website. My baggage was delayed from my flight from nyc to Panama City beach, Florida with a layover in Charlotte. The big tech shortage happened, so I didn’t want to place to much blame initially, so I filled out the form and tried to wait patiently. But now it’s the next day and there has been no confirmation of my baggage arriving or in route. In fact after tracking my bag, not through the delayed baggage system, I saw that it was sent to Dallas, Texas. Also I’ve been on hold for now 36 minutes after being on hold yesterday for an outrageous amount of time. They clearly lean heavily on automated messages and communication systems. There needs to be accountability! I’m fuming because I never check bags but had items for my sister’s bachelorette goodie bags that couldn’t go as carry-on. I hope American Airline has an internal reckoning and gets their act together. It’s unprofessional, disrespectful and inappropriate. I won’t be flying with them again if I can avoid it."
161,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am done. I am never booking with American again. Furthermore, after this most recent fiasco, I am canceling my advantage credit card with them. I don't care what it does to my credit score. I am done. Got to BNA for a 2:30 flight. Delayed until 3:44. Not a big deal. But my connection from Philly to Hartford was first delayed by 4 hours (now leaving when it was supposed to land in Hartford). Then another hour. Now the gate agents are telling us there is no captain for the flight, making us wait in a freezing cold airport whose amenities are all shutting down for the night. I paid extra for this flight because it was supposed to get in at 10:30pm. Now when I get to Bradley I will have no ride. I will have to wait at Bradley until the morning (5-7 hours) before someone can come get me. Gate agents utterly unfriendly and hostile to people who paid a lot of money for these flights. I was used to them chronically being late. I was used to the planes being dirty. But this ""sorry no captain just wait and wait and wait"" business, coupled with the utter sticky grimy filth of the plane I just flew on. I will drive before I will fly with them again. Please be warned fellow travelers. American is a ripoff with terrible customer service and absolutely unreliable flights."
162,"✅ Trip Verified |  This has been the worst flight I’ve ever had. I decided to spend 4 nights in Cancun for my yearly trip out of the country, and while my trip was fine every flight I had was terrible. I flew from Lexington, KY had a stop in Charlotte, NC before going to Cancun, Mexico. I went back the same way. My first flight was delayed for an hour and 30 minutes causing me to miss my connecting flight. So I ended up having to get another flight which ALSO ended up being delayed for an hour and 30 minutes. After my time at the resort I’d put it behind me, but when I was driven back to CUN around 1pm. My flight was delayed until 10AM the next day. I ended up staying the night in the airport and having to check in again. When I finally made it to Charlotte around 2:30PM, the final flight was also delayed and it was delayed 4 hours. I’m never flying with American Airlines again, and I’m never connecting in Charlotte again. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. Fly delta or Allegiant."
163,"Not Verified |   Rebooked my flight from Lubbock to Dallas stranding me in Dallas overnight. Fargo has very few flights from Dallas, which is why I was flying in the afternoon. Unwilling to provide accommodations for me. Awful experience. Would not recommend."
164,Not Verified |   I booked and paid for seats. I went to desk with correct info. I was told it was false and we were moved to regular seating then charged a 2nd time (on accident) they claim and could not refund the money for the 4 seats I didn't even purchase. I have spoken to customer service and they claim it's not their issue and I can't get a refund for the 270 bucks they charged us. Then on the way back they removed my whole seats on accident again and put my family in all separate seats on the plane. And charged us again for seats that we didn't get. I will never fly this airline again.
165,"✅ Trip Verified |  The most miserable air crew I have came across. I understand that work can be tiring, most of us have jobs, however we should all work towards better customer service. I got one smile off the host during the service, (not the usual host that came through the rest of the 9hr flight). The biggest smile I received was when we exited the plane. I would avoid AA in the future (running back to Singapore air). They insisted I check in my hand luggage due to a full flight. I have had this case for 10years with no issues, 1 hr being handled by AA (Dallas to Houston)."
166,"Not Verified |   Very disappointed with wheelchair assist. First flight Pittsburgh to Chicago excellent assist, also to Springfield on 7-09-24. Did change gate without notice, gate attendant did call for wheelchair assist. Coming home 7/13/24 ,the Springfield to Dallas flight was over an hour late, we arrived at Dallas after my plane to Pitt had left no wheelchair was waiting at the gate, attendant had to make several calls finally called her manager, finally wheelchair arrived. The assistant was very kind and took me to the help desk where I was able to book a flight To Pitt and he took me to the gate A17. Sitting there, they changed the gate to A8,,I walked from A17 to A8 because I wasn't sure about waiting again for a wheelchair The flight was late taking off. It was a very stressful day the airline is very unorganized, lacks communication skills, only after I got home did I see that they had sent me E-mail regarding all the changes. The should text people. They also should be more aware of assisting those with mobility issues, that's why I asked for assistance and it was scheduled for each flight. Not sure I will use this airline again."
167,"Not Verified |   By far the worst traveling experience I have ever had. Starting in San Diego, my plan was to go to Eagle Vail Airport in Colorado with a layover in Dallas Fort Worth. The troubles started immediately, with my flight being delayed multiple times, without clear reason as to why. Because of these delays, I would not be able to make my connecting flight. So, I contacted their customer service via phone call and the operators seemed almost clueless and were not helpful in the slightest. I had to explain multiple times my situation for them to finally understand. I had to travel to Pheonix, which that flight was of course delayed by 2 hours, then from Pheonix to Grand Junction Colorado, in which that flight I had to run across the airport because of the constant delays in San Diego. Because of this change in destination, I lost my rental car that I had booked in Eagle Vail, with no way to get there from Grand Junction. Today, July 17th, 2024, I was traveling home from Colorado, and the problems started early. My flight from Eagle Vail to Dallas Fort Worth at 2:30 pm was yet again delayed several times, eventually leaving at 6:30 PM and causing me unable to make the connecting flight to San Diego. I again contacted American Airlines and again they were useless to me. I had to call 10 times before they picked up and they decided to put me in a hotel in Dallas and then catch a flight to San Diego the next morning. However, for some reason, they did not tell me the name of the hotel but said they would email it to me. But when I landed in Dallas at 11:00 PM, there was no email. I had to call them again and was put on hold until finally, they answered. The most they could do was stick me in a filthy hotel in Dallas, 30 minutes away from the airport (in which I had to pay for the transportation). I eventually got home, not without my flight in the morning being delayed though. I am not even sure how that is possible seeing that it is one of the first flights of the day and the airplane is already at the gate. But, leave it to American to mess it up. The worst traveling experience I have ever had purely because of this Airline's poor coordination and utter incompetence to help people. I will never fly American Airlines again, and I suggest you don't either."
168,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had such a horrible experience recently. For starters, my departure flight was delayed. Then we took a detour to Texas in the middle of our route and had to land there to get on to another plane which delayed my trip for more than 3 hours as I was traveling to a business conference. After getting arriving 4 hours late, It still wasn't the end. When it was time to take my returning flight, it was supposed to leave at 7:20 p.m. but then got delayed until 11:00, but then got delayed until 3:00 a.m. but then got delayed until 6:00 a.m. And then was completely canceled. I had to then out of pocket pay for a hotel for the night until the next day. By the time they rescheduled my flight the next day, they sent me an email 3 hours before departure stating this is your new flight. Not even giving me enough time to go. I sent several emails to customer relations to be compensated for this and the most that they can offer me was 12,500 miles, which isn't even enough to take me to Orange county from JFK in the first place. Which which that was my round-trip flight. They also offer to send me a check for the price of the hotel night. But in reality when your flight has been completely canceled and significantly changed for over 4 hours, you are entitled to twice the price of the initial ticket. They didn't even offer me half as much. I may never fly American again and I'm an AA member."
169,✅ Trip Verified |  Smooth flight to DFW. Flight attendants provided friendly service. For once the ICE systems did not work flawlessly. I had to connect and reconnect to watch a movie and finally gave up b/c of buffering. Plenty of room in Main Cabin Extra. Food and beverages consisted of snacks and beverages as is common amongst all domestic carriers.
170,"✅ Trip Verified |  Why did I not hear all the stories of terrible customer service, rude employees, and mistreatment before I booked 12 of us to travel to Guatemala for a week to serve in third-world poverty? We will gladly pay the $200/person we thought we were saving by going with American next time. After being delayed several times for Flight 1027 at 6:03 pm with almost no communication except for online updates, they finally boarded us at 10 PM. We sat on the runway and the pilot gave us updates every 20 minutes or so that we were waiting for enough fuel should we need to reroute to another airport. He was clearly growing more frustrated and told us he had ""called Dallas"" to try to get fuel. (We didn't know if Dallas was a person or place, but now know it's the headquarters.) At just after midnight the pilot informed us that we still hadn't gotten the fuel delivery and told us, ""I am leaving this flight, someone will tell you what will happen next."" First, a delay to 3:00 AM popped up for a minute and then changed to 5 AM departure. By the time we were deboarded, thanks to the efficient and friendly flight crew (the only highlight) it was after 12:30 AM. They told us to get in line for a free hotel voucher or meal voucher ($12). The hotel voucher offer was pretty useless since we would have to return to the airport 2+ hours before the flight and it was already 1 AM. How much sleep would we have gotten after waiting in line, waiting for a hotel shuttle, checking into the hotel, and then getting the shuttle in time for the morning at 3:00 AM? We slept on the disgusting Miami International Airport floor with dozens of others, freezing from the AC. (They forced us to gate-check our carry-ons so most of us were in t-shirts.) Wait, there's more! At about 4:15 AM when boarding was supposed to begin and everyone was crowded around, an apologetic gate agent announced, ""Ladies and gentlemen, I know you are expecting to leave at 5 but I am here to tell you that is not going to happen."" He explained he had a pilot available but no cabin crew. (Mismanagement again with false promises.) American finally got us off the ground at around 9 (I am foggy on this detail, exhausted). When we arrived in Guatemala we were unable to keep our original plans. Instead of driving to our remote destination where we planned to begin work a few hours before we had to get lodging in the city to get some sleep rather than begin exhausted. Of course, I reached out to American Airlines Customer Service requesting some form of compensation for the mismanagement, lack of communication, and mistreatment during this flight. This was not an understandable weather event or mechanical problem. ""Please accept my sincere apologies for the experience you've described,"" was the scripted reply. Unfortunately, American Airlines caused us expenses that could have been used to benefit the people we went to help. My advice after hearing from others telling similar stories? Spend the extra money to avoid flying American Airlines. (We'll also be avoiding the dumpy Miami International Airport. It is badly in need of renovations.)"
171,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sent my kids-first time flying alone- first class from RI to NC last yr. AA delayed their flight 3x over 7hrs before putting them on a diff flight, separated, in middle seats. Fine..it happens. After a yr of calling (3 or 4x), I gave up getting the 2k back we lost on downgrade not to mention compensation for a 7hr delay. Fast forward this yr and my wife, kids and I have flown 12 times (American) between us in the last 6 months because our airport is their hub and not many options exist at reasonable times outside AA. Not once!! Have any of us flown without a significant delay. Always mechanical issues, staff and more recently “ghost” weather issues. Last night was the final straw. We flew from Palm Beach to Charlotte (90 min flight). We arrived at 11am for a 1:40 flight, checked in one bag and relaxed a bit. Notified instantly there was a 30min delay. Ok…20 mins later, 30 more min delay. 15 min later, 45 more min delay. Zero counter agents present to talk to. Called main number: mechanical. Ok. 2 other AA flights nxt to us also delayed an hr at a time for 7hrs. Also supposedly mechanical issues.  By 4pm I called a 3rd time and agent said “listen, not sure this flight is makn it to u but I can put u on a 7:20 direct. There are 15 seats left so I suggest u take them now”. I said fine. We were beat but we needed to be home for work in morning. Meanwhile, both flights next door kept getting pushed back as well. Anyway, we waited. Around 6pm we were notified 30min delay. Weather?! I checked: Phily to Palm Beach flight - 2% precipitation, 2mph winds, 81 degrees, sunny and clear inside 150mile radius of the Phily flight being delayed for weather. Zero weather issues between Phily and Palm Beach. 20mins later, another hr delay. 8:45 departure time now and we’ve been here since 11am. A counter agent showed up, I asked what was going on? He said they use “weather” to avoid having to compensate and when the phone agent “guided” me to take another flight, I lost all compensation from earlier mechanical delays and that they’re trained to do this with zero regard for customer satisfaction. Meanwhile the other flights next to us continued to be delayed an hr at a time until 11pm departures. I don't know what has changed since covid, but this airline has zero regard for it’s customers. They’re deceptive and unethical. They don't care about anything other than they’re bottom dollar and they do everything possible to avoid compensation for horrendous service. Furthermore, they’ve jacked the prices up so high that it cost us 800 ea to fly economy from Fla to Nc. I can fly to Paris round trip for half of that on other airlines. They never ever give u the truth about these delays and stall in 30min increments even though they’re fully aware of the final outcome. I cherish the day that this nxt generation uses all it’s platforms to blacklist these airlines out of business or at least force them to focus on quality vs profit. We arrived at 10:20. Sat on tarmac for 30min and spent an hr waiting for our luggage that never arrived."
172,"✅ Trip Verified | This airline is terrible in almost all aspects. The food quality to the service to the planes itself are shameful by any standard. Boarding on business class and I was not acknowledged in anyway. The passengers around me were offered drinks and a welcome while I was completely ignored. There was no slippers in the seat even though every other seat had one. When asked for one there didn't have any, and when I tried to call the FA the light was ignored until I had to physically flag someone down. I've had better service on budget Airlines in basic economy. Wifi was suppose to be available but never able to connect the entire flight. This company should go out of business."
173,"Not Verified |   An airline that's only good for carrying freight, not passengers. For a country that prides itself on being advanced, it's shameful that such a low-quality airline is offered to customers. Apart from the poorly maintained planes, which sometimes have water leaking from the ceiling, the food served is worse than prison food. Charging for checked baggage and not providing headphones to passengers are other major flaws of this terrible airline. The service was extremely poor, and the food was served in low-quality plastic containers, which were not suitable for hot meals. Passengers, lacking headphones, had to play their TV audio out loud or use their phones at high volume, causing disturbance to others. Overall, it is truly a bad airline."
174,"✅ Trip Verified |  I want to shed light on American Airlines and their horrible experience they have given me and my child. From a cancelled flight coming out of New Orleans, American has not been accommodating to its customers. Once our flight was cancelled we waited in line for over 2 hours to get rerouted home to Nashville. This was on Monday, 7/8, the gate agent said I can’t get you on a flight home until Wednesday morning. Being in a city we are not familiar with we were left to oblige by the new flight. When asked do we get any accommodations they said oh yeah I will accommodate one night in a hotel and a $12 voucher per person. We were being delayed for 2 days so when I asked for additional night, they said I had to wake up early bring all my luggage back to the airport to get another night accommodation. First off that is ridiculous 2nd why do I have to inconveniently bring all my stuff back to the airport to get another hotel voucher and go back to the hotel with our stuff? Not to mention what meal in an airport is $12. They gave us $12 for one day. I found a flight myself that would get us home on 7/9 that went from New Orleans to Miami then Miami to Nashville. I called customer service myself and got my flight changed after being told they couldn’t get me out til Wednesday. Today, 7/9 we get up check out the hotel and head tot the airport where we had to be there for 6 1/2 hours before our flight left due to check out time. I went to the counter to ask for another meal voucher and they said you already got one. I had to ask for a supervisor and complain for us to get another $12 voucher for the day. It’s about an hour out from us about to take off for Miami and we see our flight is delayed by 15 minutes not to bad but I started to look closely. There was not plane at our gate. Here it is 645, when we were supposed to leave at 6:30 and no plane. The plane arrives at 7 and they rushed the boarding process to try and take off and now we are on a delay while on the plane because of weather. We sat on the hot plane a whole 1 hour before they sent the people out to load our luggage, which took an additional 30 minutes. It is now 804 and I am now going to clearly miss our connection home, which left Miami at 1030pm. We finally depart and arrive to Miami at 11:10pm. I go to customer service to get another flight home to Nashville. She books us then I ask for hotel accommodation and meal vouchers and they stated you already had one and we can not issue you another one. I said so me and my daughter because of your original cancelled flight have to suffer and sleep at the airport. They shrugged their shoulders and said sorry. I then went to go find my luggage and see about finding a hotel at midnight and they can’t find my luggage. The lady from American said it will meet you in Nashville in the morning. I said so I have no luggage no place to stay no food and that’s ok with y’all. I am shocked and here we are 7/10 my daughters birthday stuck in a hotel with only the clothes on our back, no food, no toiletries and all we can do is thank American Airlines for not being willing or accommodating to their customers. I am not the only one affected as that flight that was cancelled on 7/8 out of New Orleans had over 90 passengers who all had to begged American to give them some type of compensation. This is not ok, I am mentally and physically exhausted. "
175,"✅ Trip Verified |  I wish I would've read reviews before booking my flight. American completely ruined the first day of a vacation for my family. Apparently constant ""maintenance"" issues and excuses for delays are very common with them. Weather was great, flight boarded on time, come time for take off, oh we have an issue, it'll be 45 min. Then after another 30 come with more delays and excuses but then offer to allow people to get off the plane, but not other flights going to Key West so if you get off you're SOL. After an hour and a half we were taken off the plane, told to walk to a completely different terminal, and gate, which isn't an easy task at such a large airport. Eventually loaded on the second plane only to be left sitting for another hour+ before takeoff. The 3 hour delay meant the rental car place was closed when we arrived. Was my first and I promise will be my last American Airlines flight."

177,"Not Verified | I would never recommend nor fly with America Airlines again. I booked a flight several months prior with an initial connection at ORD of 2 hours and 10 minutes of which I paid $600 (for one way). A few weeks before my flight I received an email that my connection flight was changed to only 50 minutes, then furthermore it changed to only a 38 minute connection. I contacted customer service that day of which they told me I would be fine with that connection, that AA does not book flights that passengers cannot make connections. To be on the safe side, I paid an additional $25 to get a seat near the front of the plane for my first flight so that I could plan to quickly get to my second plane. Unfortunately, there were no other options to get to my destination on that date so I was very limited in my options but felt assured by the $625+ spent on one flight that American Airlines would get me to my destination on the day planned. The day of my travel arrives, flight was running on time, boarded on time. Then once boarding was complete the pilot announces that there is weather east of ORD and we would need to add significant amount of time to our flight along with needing more fuel (this was the first flight of the day for this plane, why would fuel not already have been filled?!). So after an additional 40 minutes of fueling we finally took off. We arrived in ORD over an hour late and then had to sit and wait for a gate. I expressed my concerns about my connection to multiple airline attendants who said “maybe they would hold the plane since it’s the only one going to MSO today.” Once finally off the plane, I ran across ORD airport in hopes that maybe my flight was waiting, unfortunately it was not and the attendant couldn’t have been more rude, telling me to just go see customer service. 50 minutes in the customer service line (with many disgruntled AA passengers) I researched what else I could do to still make it to Montana since no one at American was willing or able to assist. Fortunately, I found a flight to an airport of which was 2.5 hours from my destination so I asked if I could have a seat on that flight as someone must have missed that connection. I waited another hour until that delayed plane departed but fortunately was able to ride that one. I then had to proceed to pay $175 for a rental car to drive the 2.5 hours to my initial airport on top of arriving half a day late. I sent my complaint to American Airlines asking to be refunded the $175 I paid for a rental of which I was fully dismissed by a generic response from customer relations department. I will never recommend anyone to fly American Airlines due to total lack of planning, preparation and horrible customer service."
178,"✅ Trip Verified | I booked American airlines for a July 9, 1024 flight. The 1st mistake I made. The flight was ECP-Charlotte-LGA changed to a later fight which AA didnt bother to tell me, luckily I had an 11am flight and it was changed to a 1245pm flight because it was delayed. From there no flight was on time both flights were delayed. Should have went with Delta"
179,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience ever. I bought a flight two months in advanced, pay for seats traveling with my family and they changed the aircraft. Did not respect seats, they separated the 4 of us and besides that sent our carry on to check in, still having space inside the plane. I expected not to check my bag going on a 7 day cruise, I got ready not to check any bag because I had previously lost a bag in my last trip and they did what they wanted to do. when I asked them for an explanation they said you can go or not if you want. That is not an answer for a passenger that had previously travel on the same airline many times. Very unprofessional, I am very dissatisfied And they need to return the money I paid for the seats"
180,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bad attitudes amongst staff, troubles getting flights to take off, and having consistently delayed flights. Arguably the worst experience I’ve ever had flying, ever."
181,✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely the worst people at the ramp. Y'all hire anything with an attitude that stinks and take low pay. Then customers that make sure American can still be an airline and pay the airlines fees and their employees checks then have to deal with their employees attitudes. Spirit and Frontier surpass American by a long shot and they're cheaper yes the customers are rough around the edges but they hire quality employees. American is different they want the employees with attitudes and customers nice and prestigious.
182,Not Verified | Worst experience ever we waited 3hr 23min they said because of “rain” but on American I have flown in rain tons of times and after rain stoped they deboarded the plane and said it was raining but clearly weather forecast says not raining.
183,Not Verified | Rude customer service consistently. The group of admin folks at the boarding gate just give snarky remarks when the app is saying different things. They prioritize talking to each other rather than good customer service.
184,"✅ Trip Verified |  The entire plane had to deplane due to a malfunction - originally told it would be a 2 hr delay but turned out to be 8hrs. No apologies, told not to bother the gate staff for assistance and that we would be given a QR code to rebook our flights - none were given and we were told to gather our bags and go back to the ticket counter. Missed my connecting flight and had to rebook via customer service who would not honor nor credit my first class upgrade because it was an add on. When the initial flight did resume, it was practically empty and the flight attendants were dismissive and rude. I was panicked that I would only have 30 min to catch my connecting flight, which was located at another terminal and was seeking information on whether I should deplane and book another flight for the next day - I was told by the flight attendant to return to my seat because they have more important things to handle right now. When I asked for her name she told me that she does not have to tell anyone for their name and continued to walk briskly down the aisle and ignore my issues. She went on to hide behind a partition. The audacity of this person to be so dismissive and rude is beyond comprehension but the only thing to make it all worse was American Airlines customer relations offering 2,500 bonus miles as retribution. Basically my experience and trauma is worth very little to them"
185,"✅ Trip Verified |  From the start of our trip leaving San Antonio, connecting in Phoenix for final leg to Durango, along with our return flight from Durango with connecting flight in DFW to San Antonio I experienced consistent attitude, rudeness, and impolite tone of voice and facial expressions from the gate agents. They refused to acknowledge I was standing in front of them, never even engaging me with an “I’ll be with you momentarily”. We encountered delays on two of my for legs and not a single recognition of the inconvenience, as if we are just supposed to put up with it. They acted like government employees who cared nothing about the ‘customer’ and knew there’d be no accountability for their terrible care for the customer. "
186,"✅ Trip Verified |  1st July 2024 ""celebrated"" my birthday with my 1st (and probably last) trip with American Airlines. Travelled with my autistic daughter to visit family in the US. Anyone who has a neurodivergent child knows how important routine and special possessions are to them. Her birthday was the day before we travelled, her presents were in her suitcase, as were the ""specials"" she'd saved up for and bought for the trip. I even booked special assistance for her. Flight London Heathrow to Charlotte Douglas via Dublin. My bag arrived unscathed. My daughter's (along with those of at least 5 other travellers) didn't. And despite all our endeavours, 5 days later it still hasn't. ""We're still trying to locate your bag"". Although on landing at CLT, we were told that it hadn't been loaded at LHR but should arrive within the next day. Hah! We've spent hours on the phone to AA, every day getting a different response. Including fobbing us off with non-existent phone numbers. Shame on you, American Airlines."
187,✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible and they don’t care about you! American Airlines screwed me over delaying multiple flights to and from Dallas Fort Worth making you completely miss the connection. Then sit in line for 2 hours to figure it out and they just stick you on a flight the next day with a 9 hour layover in yet another airport with a child who is allergic to most basic foods. They give you $12 a person for food and hotel by the time we were done at customer service we had 4 hours to get back between drive time with the shuttle we got 2hours of sleep! So pretty much have been stuck in airports for over 24 hours and every single person in the airport is unbelievably rude! And “it’s not their problem” but here take a standby seat but you need to you seat separately from your 3 year old.
188,"✅ Trip Verified |  Some things never change! As a weekly Road Warrior for a Fortune 100 company, I decided that American Airlines was the absolute nastiest, most disgusting excuse for an airline that I had ever experienced in well more than 1,000,000 miles traveled. Today, a decade later, I found that they are even worse even though I never thought that was possible. Out of Charlotte (gate D3) I tried to move my flight up by about two hours. I was at the airport in plenty of time, there were plenty of seats available and at the same price. The terribly rude gate agent at D3 would not help at all, even though I had an emergency illness at home with an elder family member. No standby option, nothing! She told me to try online, even though I showed her that the website would not work. I heard her tell another furious passenger that there was a Service Desk nearby (which she never bothered to tell me as I struggled!) The Service Desk turned out to be even worse, simply refusing any assistance at all‼️ How do these rude, incompetent people stay in business? This has gone on for decades and yet nothing has ever changed. I’ll crawl before I ever use this monstrous excuse for an airline again."
189,"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and I booked with American Airlines for our honeymoon ~6 months in advance. We were flying from Arkansas to Liberia, Costa Rica. The route home changed several times but the route there stayed consistent until 3am the day we were to leave (I.e. the day after our wedding). Our original flight was set to depart at 8:10am with a connection in Dallas before proceeding to Liberia. When we woke at 5:30 (set to be at the airport 2 hours prior to departure) we saw a text informing us that our flight had been delayed, which would cause us to miss our connection in Dallas, so they changed our flight to a 6:45am departure. We were on our way to the airport within 10 minutes but weren’t even allowed to check in because the flight was already leaving. When we went through the line to talk to customer service we were told to “come back tomorrow and try again”. We went through a second time and were told we could wait on standby for an undetermined amount of time, as the next flight couldn’t get us there until midnight the following day (and as we were paying ~$800 a day for the resort in costs rica that would mean we were wasting a significant amount of money and cutting our honeymoon short by 2 days). We were given a number to call with any other questions. When I called the number I was informed there were no flights that could get us there any sooner, and when I asked for a refund so I could book with another airline I was told I wasn’t eligible because I accepted the flight change. It took requesting a supervisor and about 15 minutes on hold for them to determine the flight was changed without my consent. At that point I was given the option to take a flight to Dallas with the understanding I would be on standby waiting for a flight to Liberia from there or wait until the flight the following evening. When I asked for a refund to book with United, who could get me to Liberia by 2pm that same day, they said I’d lose my reservation for the flight home and I’d have to request it through their website (their whole demeanor changed at that point and they became very short and rude). It took my extended family calling and working their way through supervisors to get the route there refunded while keeping the return flights. On the return our flight home was again delayed several times. In summary it was the worst experience my fiancé and I have ever had with an airline. "
190,"Not Verified |   My most recent experience has been the worst yet, with my flight being canceled and rescheduled multiple times. The incompetence and lack of communication are astounding. To make matters worse, the rescheduling resulted in an overnight delay, completely ruining my plans. This isn't an isolated incident; I've faced this issue multiple times with American Airlines. It's incredibly frustrating to deal with the constant uncertainty and poor service. They clearly don't value their customers' time or convenience. If you want a reliable airline, look elsewhere because American Airlines will only give you headaches and stress."
191,"✅ Trip Verified | The absolute worst. The crew is beyond rude, always late and they don’t pick up the trash from the flight before. Likely because they can’t make it on time ever."
192,"Not Verified | I recently went to Austin, Texas for the AVMA 2024 convention June 21 to 25 th. I booked 1st class traveling from DC to Charlotte - Austin, flight was delayed, so missed the connecting flight, got to Austin the following day earlier AM, around 2 am. As if that was not bad enough, the return was even worse, left my hotel 5am flight to Chicago was delayed by 2 hours, got to Chicago my connecting flight was delayed too, so I should have been able to board my flight to DC, instead I was bumped off and other people on standby were allowed to board. AA made me wait at the airport for 16 hours before I was able to get home. I paid first class money just to suffer. I arrived home 2.30 am the following day and had to be at my Vet office to see clients at 9 am. I barely had 4 hrs of sleep! I am so done with AA, years ago they messed on my trip to Hawaii, I gave another chance and they blew. I am never traveling with again."
193,Not Verified | This is the worst airline ever. With my flight experience I would say I would take my chances and ride Spirit after my time with AA. My flight was delayed by hours and the inside of the plane is burning hot. The people boarding me weren't paying attention and that's probably why I got delayed 4 hours. Never again will I ride AA after my experience.
194,"Not Verified |   There is a reason these flights are the cheapest, and it is not worth it! In fact I have spent $1,000 more now making up for their agents’ errors so I would have been money ahead flying another airline in first class! I cannot emphasize enough how terrible of an experience we have had with this airline. Between delayed flights & an agent canceling my entire return trip home from Europe, I am utterly flabbergasted by how incompetent and disorganized this company’s customer service/reservations departments have been. It’s been a month of trying to get a refund that I was promised by several employees to receive, and I am nowhere closer to a resolution. I have been lied to, hung up on, misinformed, and told different things each time I have called. At this point I have no hope of getting any sort of resolution, but I will do what I can to make sure that I share our experience and dissuade anyone from ever doing business with this abhorrent company."
195,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight was canceled in New York to Miami. After hours of trying to find another flight we ended up paying $1800 and flew United to Orlando, rented a car and drove to Miami. We were awake for 26 hours before reaching our destination. This was over a month ago and still haven’t received a refund. I have called customer service countless times and still no refund. The app they keep referring me to doesn’t work and they refuse to issue my refund over the phone. I’ve been hung up on and sent down many rabbit hole from customer support. My wife and I do a lot of traveling however we will never fly American Airlines again. I have never had this much trouble with any airline. I don’t usually leave reviews however I’m hoping this can save someone from the trouble we have experienced."
196,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a 67-year-old woman who was flying alone. My direct redeye flight was canceled and I was told it’s weather related so vouchers aren’t given. That became the least of my problems. My new American Airlines flight from JFK to CLT was fine. The second flight to RDU was canceled. I was unable to pull up my boarding pass for the next flight, so I stopped at a gate agent, handed him my license and told him my last name. He printed me a ticket. After many confusing texts from American Airlines about gate changes, I stopped at Customer Assist to get the correct gate. I handed my license and my paper ticket to her. She told me the gate. While on a full plane, I am approached by American Airlines staff who asked me my last name. I frantically try to get my license out. I am told I am sitting in another person seat. Their last name started with the same letters. Apparently, the agent that gave me the paper ticket never looked at my license, but upon hearing me state my name found this man’s ticket and issued it to me. I tried to explain through my panic and tears the situation. As I was escorted off the plane, humiliated and frantic, I apologized to the passengers whose flight I delayed. The gate agent at that area gave me my correct paper ticket although unsympathetic. I was then told my plane which was taking off in a few minutes and of course the gate was on the other side of the terminal. I ran through the crowds at the very large and spread out Charlotte airport. The gate agent there was the only one who showed me kindness after seeing my demeanor. This was not only unacceptable but unavoidable. I am writing this four days later and I am still upset over this experience."
197,"✅ Trip Verified |  My return flight home was delayed twelve hours for unplanned aircraft maintenance, which was barely mentioned by the attendant at the terminal - I instead found out via an email informing me of the delay 30 minutes before boarding was scheduled to begin. When I asked at the desk if I could cancel so I could catch a sooner flight with another airline that had actually working airplanes, they looked at me like it was absolutely absurd to consider they could help me with anything in person, and seemed offended that I was disturbing them from doing nothing at all, seeing as there was no flight leaving this terminal at this time now and they were just standing at the desk chatting with each other having a good time. I was told to take a seat pull out my laptop and figure out how to cancel the flight on my own through the website. Non-existent customer service."
198,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a horrendous experience. My flight was delayed after I checked in at the airport which made me miss my connection. I had to stay in Nashville an additional night with no baggage. I then rebooked for the following day, with more delays. When I walk up to the gate I was told my gate changed and I cannot get on the last flight coming home. I finally escalated to a Supervisor who was able to assist me with getting on a plane. She was as rude as the gate agent and was very reluctant to help me. American Airlines really needs to up their customer service."
199,✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines should be given an award for most consistently bad service. Our flight left 1 hour and 20 minutes late for reasons unknown and when I asked what time would we arrive because I had 50 minutes to take my next flight the flight attendant said I don’t know and could clearly care less. We arrived 1 hour and 15 minutes late which caused me to wait 5 hours for the next flight. I have experienced this many times with AA and their staff coudl care less. The only efficiency they have shown is to immediately take your money as soon as you book. As for the service they provide  it’s “ohwell your get their when we can”. I have given them way too many changes. From now on I will ensure never to take AA again.
200,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight departed over 3 hours late causing me to miss connection to Australia. Ground staff were unhelpful and did not seem to care. This caused out of pocket expenses as I was re-routed via Sydney, instead of direct to Brisbane. As per AA Terms and Conditions, they will reimburse costs when delays are caused by them. I have been trying for over a month to get hold of AA to arrange refunds of added transport costs etc with no responses. Have emailed 5 times, rang their number in Australia, and told to email, tried to fill in an online form on AA website, without success (keeps crashing) and tried to call AA in America, however with 40 min plus wait times, was too expensive. Very frustrated as apart from the anxiety that the delays caused, they also put me out of pocket which by their own website they refund. Will not fly AA again, have had much better experiences with Delta"
201,"✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst experience ever. We will never fly this airline again. The flight was delayed, we then got on the plane only to be told to get off and the flight was delayed another 10 hours. To be rebooked on a flight that took us extra days to get to our destination and now we are dependent on vouchers for a hotel! "
202,"✅ Trip Verified | I will never again fly American Airlines. Customer service is absolutely terrible. These people sent me to the wrong gate number as a result I missed my flight. I had to wait 7 hours for the next flight. The worst thing about it is that they made me feel like it was my fault. Also, as Im waiting at the new gate with my luggage, an American Airlines employee came and took my bag when I got up to use the restroom. I was literally gone for 5 minutes. She said it was because it was unattended. Again, super rude about as If I was an idiot for leaving it for 5 minutes to use the restroom. Never again!"
203,"Not Verified |  Flight took off early and left my family of 6 and 8 other passengers. We were unable to get a flight out for 2 days!! We missed 2 days of vacation which we paid for. Our luggage was on the plane when it left so it was lost for 2 days. Return flight was horrible, first AA does not transfer your luggage through customs so we had to go to the baggage claim and wait 2.5 hours for our luggage to come. It was mixed with 2 other flights. Once we got our luggage we had to take it around the corner and had it back off to AA and then had to go back through security. So glad we had a 4 hour delay! Our plane was on the runway and ready to take off and then the captain comes on and said she has gone over her flight hours. We had to return to the terminal. AA said they were trying to find another pilot. We sat on the plane for 45 minutes and then had to exit the aircraft. our flight was scheduled for 9:45. It was delayed 6 times. We had to sleep on the floor at the airport. The flight didn't leave until 7:00 the next morning. The staff were so rude! I couldn't believe the way they treated the passengers. They wouldn't get you vouchers and said if we didn't stay at the airport we would not get on another flight until later that day or even the next day. Told us if we wanted to get our luggage off the plane it would take up to 3 hours to get it off. I will NEVER FLY AA AGAIN!! Please don't make the same mistake I did."
204,"Not Verified | The flight was supposed to depart to Doha at 8.45 pm. For some reason it was delayed until 12.30. At 12.30, they allowed passengers to board the flight. Once everyone was seated, there came an announcement that they cannot fly as some allowed time has crossed. All the passengers were asked to go back to the terminal. And every American Airlines staff left. One guy came and said AA cannot provide the accommodation as the delay was due to weather. Checked in baggages were not given back, no staff was available to rebook the flight/connection flight. No one had a clue on where the baggages were. What kind of company will just abandon their international passengers in the terminal and let them figure out things on their own? I have had bad experiences flying before but no one showed this level of arrogance and irresponsibility."
205,Not Verified |   I have flown on 6 AA flights since April 27th. Every single one was late by at least an hour. I am sitting in Charlotte now waiting to get on a flight to Raleigh. It is 1:45 late assuming it takes off. It is a miserable airline. It has been a miserable airline for years.
206,"Not Verified |   Writing this complaint because we missed our connecting flight from Monterey to Phoenix. Delayed in Monterey for close to an hour. Unknown reason for the delay, which put us in jeopardy for our connecting flight in Phoenix to get home to Pittsburgh. Got in Phoenix and off the plane by 3:25. Our connecting flight was for 3:40. Got to the gate by 3:30 and was told we were not allowed to get on the plane. It was an American flight to an American flight. Was not our fault that the connecting flight was delayed. Totally the airlines fault. We were at the gate 10 minutes before take off. Not to be allowed to board was ridiculous. Had to sit in Phoenix airport for 6 hours, catch a flight to Charlotte and not arrive there until 5:15 the next morning. 21/2 hour layover in Charlotte. Finally will get on board at 7:17 and arrive in Pittsburgh around 9:10. Miss an important doctor’s appointment scheduled for the next day. Needless to say, will never fly American Airlines again."
207,"✅ Trip Verified | Airline charges to check bags, so I packed accordingly to avoid the ridiculous fee. When getting on the plane I was required to check my bag. There was plenty of space in the over head bins, and it was an unnecessary trouble. The gate agent was also extremely rude. I hate this airline."
208,"Not Verified |   This has been one of the worst experiences I've had. First, the flight from Philadelphia to Miami was delayed, and now the one from Miami to the Dominican Republic is also delayed by more than 3 hours. And I haven't slept for 12 hours."
209,"Not Verified |   Past few flights I’ve taken in June with this airline have been horrendous. It all started with my honeymoon; delayed flight for 8+ hrs in Charlotte (overnight). A food voucher was offered after all food places were closed. Reason for delayed flight? “Short-staffed” - just to hear one of the employees say, “we don’t get paid anyway until we’re up in the air” ot wise to say in front of a group of people that just attempted to sleep at the boarding gate. Onto my trip from Boise-Dallas-Cleveland: taxied for 45 min after landing in Dallas with < 10 min to get to our gate. Mind you, my wife and I have yet to eat a meal. We rushed to get to our gate to find out that the plane hasn’t started boarding- great! Food! We are our food, and realized the boarding process has yet to begin still. 40 min later, the crew arrives with food in hand, leisurely walking. We’re grateful we got food and haven’t been waiting around for as long as the rest of this flight, but it’s still the principle of the matter. We almost missed out on getting food, yet the crew can take their time to get their food?"
210,"Not Verified |   On Friday June 14th, 2014 my family was coming home from the Bahamas to get to our hometown of Louisiana. Our stop was in Miami Airport. We were scheduled to leave Miami airport around 10:00 p.m. After we got off the plane from Nassau, we got to our terminal to take off to get on the next flight to New Orleans. However, when we go to the terminal, our flight was delayed because they did not have any flight attendants. After an hour, the pilots walked off the plane and went home and then they had no pilots to fly to plane. After 6 hours in the airport, our flight suddenly got cancelled. No flights were available until two days later. This was our first time ever flying and instead of waiting days in the airport like many others did, we decided to rent a vehicle and drive from Miami to Louisiana which was a 17 hour drive, plus no rest in two days. Instead of having a great experience, this was a nightmare that I will forever remember. The stress and burden american airlines put us through was horrible. Even worse, instead of offering us a bottle of water while we sat in the cold airport (no blankets offered), they gave us a small CUP of water for our pain and suffering. We will never fly with american airline again. "
211,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely the worst flight I have had in 50 years. Multiple delays multiple gate changes. We ended up delayed seven hours in Phoenix and the staff just really didn’t care. They offered us a $12 food credit which was not enough money for almost anything and it was only good for the day we were there. They didn’t communicate anything to us until the last minute always and we ended up getting home the next day. I will pay more to avoid American in the future. I would give them an overall rating of zero if it was allowed. Horrible, horrible horrible"
212,"✅ Trip Verified |  This has been the worst flying experience I have ever had. American Airlines should be shutdown or they should start a new hiring campaign with new standard operating procedures. When I arrived at the Airport in Rome, Italy it was about 5-6am. I took a bus from Napoli to Rome to make my flight on time. I was exhausted with no sleep. In Orlando, FL American Airlines employees work 24/7. They change shifts and cover each other, as expect in any airport. After waiting 1 hour and 30 minutes for the gate to open, I was first in line at the american airline counter. First of all, I should have never gone to the counter. I should have been able to check-in ONLINE - I didn't have a CHECKED BAG. I had a CARRY-ON and was FORCED to go talk to an American Airlines employee at the counter (SUPER RUDE - ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE). They watched me and 10 other people make a line for 45 minutes before even acknowledging us. Once I made it past TSA the experience just got worst. The AMERICAN AIRLINES staff at the gate E41 was not only sarcastic but very rude. Once I made it INSIDE the plane it kept getting worse. I flew with DELTA on my way to EUROPE. If i knew then that DELTA was so superior to AMERICAN AIRLINES I would have never booked this flight. You guys charge $30 for wifi - DELTA CHARGES ONLY $5. The staff on the AMERICAN AIRLINES flight was rude, inconsiderate, and unprofessional."
213,✅ Trip Verified | Once again there’s a delay. Every flight I’ve been on that’s been a problem. We even had to spend the night in a hotel due to aircraft issues. I’ve reached out each time to AA and have never been compensated with points or anything! Time to go back to Delta!!
214,"✅ Trip Verified |  To say I am disappointed in American Airlines is nothing but an understatement. My mom flew into the U.S from the U.K through Dublin on 6/17/24, 2 days ago and got all but two of the 6 bags she checked in at Heathrow. Upon her arrival here at DFW airport, she had to wait for 4 extra hours after traveling for over 8 hrs at the airport for her bags and she did not get them. We have since gotten a myriad of excuses from the incompetent staff members that have attended to us in person and over the phone to resolve this issue. We are totally displeased with the poor and extremely terrible service of a supervisor at the A.A desk at terminal A28 at the DFW airport. She gave us wrong bag tag numbers and lied that we will get the bags next day. Its over 48 hrs now and we have been given new tag numbers, we have been told the bags will arrive today the 19th, that the bags are in the Uk, that they are in dublin, that there is no details on them. Just a bunch of stupid, unimaginable and imbecilic excuses that makes no sense to a sane mind. This is the most excruciating experience I have had with any airline in my 40 yrs of life and I am beyond disappointed with American Airlines. "
215,"Not Verified | I have never in my life been spoken to on any airline ever the way an attendant spoke to me. It was so embarrasing to me to have her blurt out what the problem was. Yes I did have a pet carrier with me and it shouldve been under the seat, but she advertised it in such a loud horrible way that i was absolutely shocked how she went about the whole ordeal. She blurted out that it was against FAA law that pet carriers have to be under the seat which is acceptable and understandable, but the way she approached this could have been dealt in a less aggressive attitude. I am so appalled with her attitude that I will choose not to fly with this airline again. I am from New Zealand and have flown with this airline before and now I will tell everyone I know not to fly this carrier. Ive decided to cancel my advantage membership as well. She should have taken note of the other attendant who asked ""nicely"" to push it a little further under the seat. I mentioned to the old grumpy attendant she could’ve said it nicely and her angry reply was ""I did."" She also spoke like that to another passenger behind me. I heard Delta is a very good airline. I don’t care how much more I have to pay for any carrier, i wont be flying AA again and believe me I shall be searching out airline reviews online and ""spread the word"" about the atrocious treatment by this person. Its a shame one person can have such an effect on the entire airline. Just so sad!! Cabin service I would give 0."
216,"Not Verified |   Customer service 0/10. Literally don’t know anything, you should stop putting “contact us for further help” or anything along the lines of that if the agents literally just read what was emailed to the customer. Also, if you don’t have an account with them, expect even less."
217,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is by far the worst airline I've traveled with. Horrible customer service and flight attendants. Flights were postponed 3 times and then canceled. I am a cancer patient and they didn't want to accommodate me. They postponed a flight to Milwaukee the very last minute. It switched from 10:41 to 1:25am. This airline wouldn't rebook a different flight refused to give me my luggage and didn't want to reimburse me. So not only do I have to wait here for 3 hours, I'm also going to board a plane that's not in a good functioning condition (they will probably cancel it as usual-already happened 2 times on Friday when I was supposed to travel.  Stay away from them at all costs."
218,✅ Trip Verified |  I bought insurance on American. I had to cancel the flight and they didn’t refund me because my reason didn’t qualify. On another flight I wasn’t able to check in on phone. Got to airport 2 hours early and couldn’t check in at kiosk. Had to wait in main assistance line. By time I got to front was less than 40 minutes before flight and they said I couldn’t check in - re booked me for 6 hours later with no other options. Never flying American again. Go Southwest all day
219,Not Verified |   Too many delays it’s insane. I have picked 2 different flights and both are delayed. If your going to be delayed at least share the true reason once known to passengers awaiting the plane.
220,"Not Verified | American Airlines is a disgrace and I will never spend another dime on this poor excuse for an airline. The experience we- and hundreds of others- had at Charlotte Douglas Intl. yesterday was downright pathetic. Automatic check in kiosks malfunctioning leading to long lines (2.5 to 3 hrs wait time) at grossly understaffed gates leading to frustration, anger, missed flights, etc., etc., etc.... it was a disorganized disgrace, I have never seen paying customers treated so poorly. My wife ended up missing her flight, they were able to get her on another one which she made with minutes to spare, and now they've lost her luggage... so she's in Brazil with just the clothes on her back. AA you owe these people an apology. But I doubt one is forthcoming because based on what I witnessed yesterday you obviously don't care about your customers."
221,"Not Verified |   Weather delay in LGA caused us to depart 2 hours late. By the time we landed in DCA, it was 15 minutes past our connection flight departure for HSV. Evening flight, so there was surely nobody connecting in HSV. They could have held the flight 20-30 minutes to ensure we could get home on time. Nope! Attempted to use the American Airlines App Chat feature. Both agents I ended up chatting with were completely useless. Earliest flight they could get us on was two days later, with no options given. When we arrived at DCA, we had to retrieve our checked bag so we had clothes. The girl working baggage claim was super rude, first telling us that there was nothing she could do, then only after we pressed she rudely said carousel 12 in 30-60 minutes. Went back to report the luggage was damaged, she was still super rude. Finally was able to get customer service to get my family on a next day flight, while I was on standby. Understood about the weather, but American Airlines has proven they don’t care about their customers. I am ending my frequent flyer with American. I will stick with Delta or United who actually take care of their customers. "
222,"Not Verified |   I cannot even begin to describe the cruelty and shock that I’ve gone through in the past 36 hours at the hands of American Airlines. To start with, my flight to Miami was delayed due to weather issues in Miami. Upon arrival after a four hour delay where I missed my then connecting flight, I was told I would have to take a flight the next morning. No one offered any food vouchers or overnight accommodations because their policy apparently is that they won’t reimburse you for any weather related delays, I spent a sleepless and miserable night on the airport floor getting no sleep. Funny that the Miami airport doesn’t even have couches and you can’t even lay across chairs. Around 3 a.m,. a worker cleaning the floors with a loud vacuum cleaner literally vacuumed around the hundreds of bodies sprawled out on the floor. Around 6 a.m. I ""awoke"" to the news that my morning flight had been cancelled due to ""weather"" issues once again. Despite all the weather and flooding issues, other passengers were still getting out on various flights with American Airlines and other airlines which makes me suspect this was not completely weather related. At any rate, upon discovering that, I then spent the entire day standing in the customer rebooking lines for hours with other passengers in order to book a new flight out. I called the American Airlines customer service call center several times only to be told that the only way to rebook was in person with the rebooking center. After about 2.5 hrs in line, I made it to a desk agent who rudely explained to me that my only options were to be put on standby for an evening flight that day and a confirmed flight for 3 days out! Again, no food vouchers or overnight accommodations were permitted because the flight cancellation was due to ""weather"" issues. After leaving the line and trying to find a different flight and different destination, I finally found one. When I went to purchase it, it disappeared. After talking with other passengers, I discovered it was an issue with American Airlines website. So many people were trying to book new flights out online only to have the flights disappear as they were about to be purchased. I got in line a second time, this time for 3 and half hours. The line was super long and most of us stood there without food and water in order to maintain our places. Finally, after I got through the line again, the agent allowed me to book the new flight to a new destination for the next day. Despite my requests, no food vouchers or hotel accomodations were permitted. I had to book a hotel for $225 all at my own expense because American Airlines refused to lift a finger. Basically, I've been held prisoner for over 36 hours in this airport, being charged for food, water and my own overnight hotel. It surprises me they're not charging for oxygen at this point. I do not recommend flying with this airline ever! If you can avoid it (and also avoid Miami) at all costs, please do so for your own sanity and mental health."
223,"Not Verified |   My husband booked a ticket a month ago to come see me, and his first flight was cancelled due to weather. In order for us to book him another flight, we had to pay an extra $200 to fly him out a week later. The following week, he gets on his first flight and lands in DFW where he had what was supposed to be a couple hour layover. American Airlines delayed that flight several times with absolutely no explanation. At 2:45 AM the day after he was supposed to leave DFW, they cancelled the flight, again for no reason given. The line at the airport to try to rebook was backed up from one end of the hall to the other, and the phone line wait was 6-8 hours. We had to personally rebook him another flight for the next day on a different airline, from a different airport for $427. My husband and I called 20 different hotels and were lucky enough to find one room available 18 miles away for $275 for 8 hours. He then had to pay for a Lyft to pick him up from the airport to take him to the hotel and then from the hotel back to the airport. So we spent over $700 extra to get him here for only two days. We filed a reimbursement claim 3 different times with all receipts attached for them respond saying it was due to weather. However, the weather was clear that night because other flights leaving at the same time were taking off, not just at the time his was supposed take off, but each time his was delayed as well. We were not contacted by them until 3pm the following day. Even looking online, there were no more available flights until Saturday, June 1st. After several phone calls and emails in regards to this issue, they proceed to only offer him a $50 credit for his next flight. First of all, what is a $50 dollar credit going to do for us after having to spend an extra $700+ when that should have been at their expense, and second of all, what makes them think we would ever book a flight with them again? We have had to jump through so many hoops just for them to turn around showing they only care about themselves and not tarnishing their reputation. Never again will we book with American Airlines. Per their “CONTRACT OF CARRIAGE” Rebooking your delayed / canceled flight When your flight is canceled or a delay could cause you to miss your connection, we'll rebook you on the next American Airlines flight with available seats at no additional cost. If no American flights are available until the next day, and the disruption is caused by us, we’ll rebook you on one of our partner airlines with available seats at no additional cost. We’ll rebook you in your originally ticketed cabin or class with your original form of payment. Attached is a weather report for that night. If I could give zero stars in each category, I 100% would."
224,"Not Verified |   Worst airline by far, please I repeat please never fly with this company! A one hour delay turned into a almost 6 hour delay. Terminal employees misinform or are not informed themselves, the lack of professionalism in the we were rudely treated. Never again. "
225,Not Verified | Absolute garbage. They are worse than Spirit which says a lot. I heard time and time again that AA is awful. I just thought people were being dramatic until it happened to me.
226,"Not Verified | For the amount being charged to fly, planes should be an investment. Fly in a plane where the seats looked dirty, the ceiling drops water, there was no TVs and very little leg room for a being 5'4"". "
227,"Not Verified |   American Airlines is extremely unprofessional, and does not hold up to their words. My family and I had a flight from Grand Junction, CO to Dallas, TX. After that, we had a connecting flight to Paris, France. Our flight to Grand junction was delayed from 4:30pm to 6:00pm. Meaning as soon as we landed now we would miss our connecting flight to France. We rescheduled our flight to Paris before even leaving Grand Junction. The man who helped us over the phone told us to contact the agents when we landed in Dallas, and that they would give us vouchers for our inconvenience. When we landed, we talked to the agents there who turned us away (and many others). The agent, in quote told us, “This is an act of god, to put it legally.” Because of the weather, we were denied a free hotel we were promised, or any vouchers for that matter. Why were we told we would be provided with this when we were completely shut down? The agent at the counter also told us, “you can call this number to try to get a voucher, but they will just deny you.” American Airlines is extremely unprofessional, and even their employees know it. If you can avoid flying American, I would reccomend. They could atleast be more graceful with their mistakes."
228,"✅ Trip Verified |   I bought a 1st class round-trip ticket from Los Angeles to Raleigh, June 3, returning June 11th for a medical surgical trip to UNC with a wheelchair request. First leg was fine. Return trip though, it seemed that everything that could go wrong, did. At the American Airline departure counter in Raleigh, I checked in, and was told to wait for a wheelchair. 1 hour later, no wheelchair and with flight departure approaching, I forced myself to walk through TSA pre-check and to the gate. While walking to gate 25 departure gate, of course I walk past at least 2 wheelchair porters just casually walking somewhere, taking their sweet time. The flight service was ok (not good given 1st class). The food, we're offered two choices. One exotic sounding, and another a dish with eggs and cheese.  I chose some fancy breakfast name which I had no idea what it was and I got served gammy prosciutto ham, with a large side of raw almonds. You can imagine how upset I became eating almonds after face and neck surgery. I asked for a softer disk but their was nothing else...only processed chips, which I could not chew anyway. The larger point; $1,500 roundrip ticket to be served a bag of almonds. This is the last time I fly 1st class on AA and will probably back away from only flying this airline alone."
229,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew first class from Miami to Detroit. Had no TV/screens for entertainment No wifi was included - unless you wanted to watch a movie No meals were offered I was freezing the whole flight and they had no blankets or pillows. Not to mention the stewardess was extremely rude. Paid for first class and absolutely such a waste of money. I flew first class to Miami from Detroit on DELTA a few days prior Where I had free wifi Braised beef rib, salad and dessert Blanket, pillow and screens for entertainment Don't even waste your time flying American. You're better off flying Spirit or Frontier for the cost and amenities."
230,"✅ Trip Verified | They should change their name to “The Worst American Airline”, it would be more fitting. This is not my first time I’ve had an issue but the first time I’ve left a review. Our first flight was to Chicago was delayed past our departure time of our second flight to Punta Cana. No weather or anything in the area that would’ve caused it. This delay required us to push our flights to the following day, causing us to miss the first day of our vacation at a prepaid all-inclusive resort. Also, on top of that they wouldn’t sit my wife, 5 year old daughter, and I together…which I already paid extra for to pick our seats when booking. They said we’d need to spend several hundred more dollars to upgrade seats in order to sit together. This was on a flight that wasn’t full and multiple rows of the “upgraded” seats available. I reached out to customer service and even provided them with the new DOT rules regarding refunds and no additional costs for families to sit together, they basically told me that they weren’t doing anything about it. "
231,"Not Verified | First time flying this airline and it has been nothing but a headache. First arrive at Columbus airport to find out the flight is delayed. Make up time in the air due to the fact most of us have a connecting flight in Charlotte, NC. We arrive with 30 minutes to get to my connecting gate, at least I thought. Sat on the tarmac for over 30 minutes waiting for a gate to deboard at. Once we get the ok to move to the gate, my connecting AA flight has already taken off. Go to AA desk and the next flight is the next morning. They give me a hotel voucher and a 12.00 meal Voucher (that’s enough to buy a water) I have to wait 2 hours to get my bag back that they made me check due to the flight being a valet plane. I get to the hotel and it is so disgusting. The carpets in the hallways had several huge black stains, elevator was broke, no breakfast, the stench in room. Now today I fly back and what do you know my flight is delayed. I have 10 min to catch my connecting flight in Dallas. We shall see how this goes."
232,✅ Trip Verified |  Without a doubt the worst airline I fly with. I travel weekly for work and normally have to fly American Airlines per my company's request. Customer service is next level rude. Almost never have a flight where they don't mess up my check bags one way or another. Only airline I've ever seen that seems to purposely treat Retired Military like second class people. If they can't make an extra dollar off you they will absolutely do everything they can to get out of helping you in any way.
233,Not Verified |   After 2 delays due to plane issues they make up time in the air (great job) the we land and sit on the tarmac for 45 minutes. Due to a piece of equipment from the nose of the plane. We have to go through customs then get bags this took 25 minutes then we run to recheck in and the lady says we have to stand in line like everyone else there is literally 45 people on this flight being delayed to board the next flight. We were on 1723 from Cancun to Miami and we were supposed to be on 2552 from Miami to New Orleans. No one that worked for America Airlines even tried to help us in Miami. Sad cause I’ve have seen airline put these people up front so they can make there flight American did nothing but stand in line. This line took us over an hour. I would be embarrassed to say I worked for America Airlines at this point and chances are I will not fly these disrespectful unorganized people again.
234,"Not Verified |   No service. Unrecognizable food on the vegetable tray. Had to beg for coffee which was cold. Attendant was solo but never came around when seated or after meal, and sat out of view texting on phone. Is this the new normal?"
235,"Not Verified |   Total nightmare. My flight home was canceled after standing in the airport for over 8 hours with no updates. After they announced the cancelation, they then told us that we were on our own finding accommodations and that they were not giving vouchers. There were hundreds of passengers tossed on the streets of Providenciales to fend for themselves. I ended up paying $1200 for 1 night at a local resort, the only thing many of us could find. They told us at the airport that we would need to foot the bill then claim it. Then they wanted me to sit in Philadelphia waiting 8 hours for my connecting flight which was originally to take me to Buffalo NY. Well, after they rescheduled my flight, they wanted me to sit in Philly all day then fly to Charlottesville, NC to spend the night. That would have caused me to lose a 2nd day of work due to this fiasco. There were no vouchers offered so I would have had to pay for another hotel and transportation in my own. I finally made it home 2 days later. I am still fighting with this irresponsible airline to reimburse me for my accommodations in Provodenciales. They did this to hundreds of people and have shown no concern for making this right. I will never fly with them again. They lied and treated us terribly."
236,"Not Verified |   AA damaged my bag on 11 May when I arrived in Indianapolis from Austin, Texas. I retrieved my bag from the carousel and noticed it was busted on top. I took it to the customer service desk and they took my bag and gave me a case number along with a phone number to call after a week if no one had contacted me. I waited almost two weeks before calling. I spoke with a Rep about my bag replacement and they kept asking me to provide a receipt of purchase for a bag I bought over 9 months ago and to take a picture of the bag that was turned in to customer service. Then I was told someone from AA would reach out to me. Need I remind you my bag was damaged on 11 May and I have yet to receive a call or replacement bag since then. "
237,"✅ Trip Verified |  Will never fly American Airlines again.  Flying from IND via LAX to SFO. Checked in 24 hours before departure, all flights were shown as “on time”. On the day of departure, waking up to an automatic rebook to BOS, then to JFK, then to SFO a day later. Without any indication what we needed to do at JFK for 10 hours! Had to call a real agent, and after 29 minutes, the agent rebooked us onto Alaska airlines, arriving midnight. Yes we arrived at SFO at midnight instead of early evening. Now flying out of SFO back to IND via ORD. After security clearance, the flight status indicated a 23 minutes delay, then 25. Boarded, but they were not in a hurry. Still staying at the tarmac. Our flight from ORX to IND has a 50 minute connection time. Now we are going to miss the connection. The crew has no intention of closing the door. This is incredible. Will see what happens. After more than an hour the captain came online and told all that he could not fly because he’s clocked out and tired and safety was number 1, so he cancelled the flight. No ground crew is available so we were stuck on the airplane. Calling American’s 800 number and because I’m shown as in air, she was not able to rebook. Finally deplaned and waiting in line for the counter agent while calling. The agent on the phone can’t find any flight and asked me to wait at the counter. Not much a movement at the counter after another hour. After 2.5 hours the gate agent booked us on a different airline for tomorrow morning. I have to call out the rebooking agent. He was very helpful. Thank you David. Avoid this airline at all cost. Their senior management team needs to resign or cut their pay to compensate their crew."
238,✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines is an 8.8 billion dollar company that can’t figure out how to function. I fully believe there needs to be an investigation launched. They never get flights off the ground on time. They strand passengers in foreign countries. They cause people to miss work and sleep and do not care. Their staff are grossly underpaid and it shows in how uninterested they are in doing their jobs. They cost me two days of earned wages and left me with a pinched nerve in my neck. They told me to contact customer service for which I was on hold for SEVENTEEN HOURS. Do NOT fly AA. It is not worth it and they do not deserve a single penny more until they can pay competent staff. Pay a little more and actually get to your destination. I lost more money than I saved because of American Airlines.
239,"Not Verified |   Flew from Richmond to Charlotte headed to New Orleans. When I got off the plane, I realized I left my purse and told the attendant. She just stood there looking stupid. It took one of the oncoming Flight attendants to help me get them to check. Checked the wrong seat came back and said they didn't see it. Was adamant they check again and they found it. Flight from Richmond to New Orleans was delayed from 9pm to 5am! Asked for a full refund because I would miss my event. They did refund my money, put me in a roach motel and gave me a flight returning back home the next morning at 7. Morning Flight was delayed again. The customer service of the staff at the Charlotte Airport is trash! I will never fly with this airline again. Could use some refresher train for the crew at this location. Was headed to a memorial but due to the lack of organization of the crew, I would have missed it. Thank you American!"
240,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am an Active Duty Soldier and have never been so disrespected in my life. I flew from Atlanta to Dallas to pick up my son for the Summer. Our flight from Dallas back to Atlanta was suppose to departed at 1237 however, the flight kept getting delayed. I asked why the flight kept getting delayed and they said staffing. Around 1900 (almost 7 hours later) they cancelled the flight and lied and said it was because of weather. I asked for a hotel and food voucher and was told the flight was cancelled because of weather and that's not American Airlines fault so they won't give a voucher for anything. I explained to them I was told numerous times the flight was delayed because of staffing and they said I was lying. I asked to speak to a manger and she came and stated, ""I will not talk to anyone on the Atlanta flight"" and called the police. I asked to retrieve my son's bag and they said no I couldn't get the bag because it's too much work on the ground crew to give everyone their bags. I was rebooted on a flight for 1921 (7:21pm) the next day. I asked what am I supposed to do with my son in the airport for over 24 hours with none of our stuff and a staff member told me to be a better father. American Airlines refused to compensate the passengers for canceling the flight because they didn't have the staff for flight and lied and said it was cancelled because of weather. I spent so much money on feeding me and son (bored and tired of being in the airport) and had to spend $123 on a minute suite for 8 hours so my son felt safe while we slept. This is ridiculous and worse airline and customer service I ever experience. I understand things happen but assume responsibility and don't make your paying customer suffer. I will never purchase my own American Airline ticket."
241,"✅ Trip Verified | I am beyond upset. I left my house driving nearly an hour to the airport, parked in a parking garage (parking fee), shuttled (tip) to the airport, got through security and was sitting there by 9 am, 2 hours before boarding ($110 in the restaurant). Maybe ½ hour before boarding I get a message the flight was delayed, then it was cancelled, then I was rebooked for another flight. I stood in line for ½ hour only to find that the 3rd flight I was “rebooked” on was cancelled and the received a boarding pass for the next day boarding at 7:27 am directly to Phoenix. I had to wait another 2 hours in baggage claim to find my luggage I checked. Then drive an hour home, just to do it all again the next day. I was at the airport for over 7 hours for nothing! When I checked in at 5 am May 17th AA tried to charge me to check my bag. I prepaid to have 1 bag free. Apparently they didn't show that I got my bag back May 16th. If this trip was for pleasure, that would be one thing. My dad passed away May 3rd and we had planned a family dinner may 16th, and May 17th setting pictures, flowers, etc. up at the church for his service May 18th, Saturday morning. This is completely unacceptable. I should get a total refund for my inconvenience."
242,"Not Verified |   I will never fly American Airlines again. It took me 2 days to get home from Ohio. My scheduled flight was at 12:47pm. I got the airport at about 10:30. The flight was delayed because of no pilot. At one point they told us they found a new flight crew and that they were on their way. 2 hours later and still no flight crew. When questioned, they attendant said they they haven't found a flight crew yet. Someone said that told us on the load speaker they a crew was on the way (which many of us heard), they said they never said that. A total lie. All day they just kept changing the departure time wasting our time sitting there all day. I could have tried to find a different flight, but they just kept dinking around with us. I didn't end up leaving until almost 6pm the NEXT day. Horrible service and a waste of two days. I will never fly with them again."
243,"✅ Trip Verified | American is the worst airline I have ever flown and will never fly here again. I had a flight at 2:50ish on a Thursday. We get a delay, then another delay until it’s delayed until the next morning where the flight was suppose to depart at 8:00am. I’m here at 6:30 and then we get another delay to 10:30, then we get another delay to 4:00pm. I’ve checked out of my hotel, have now wasted well over 24 hours and more money I didn’t want to spend but had to. Turns out there’s something wrong with the plane window and they don’t have the parts in Fort Lauderdale to fix it so they had it shipped what the guy initially said Miami, now he’s saying the parts aren’t even in the state. No one could have the decency to issue reimbursements, vouchers, nothing, to the people they’ve screwed over for this flight. One lady had to see someone before that person died and they said there was nothing they could do cause all the flights to Chicago were sold out on every other airline as well. The incompetence of this airline will go down in every story I ever casually talk about flying. Shame on you this airline. You’ve lost a customer. Will never spend another dime with you all because of this awful experience."
244,"✅ Trip Verified |   Bucking a trend here I have mostly positive things to say. Although the flight was late (mechanical plus thunder storms) the experience up front has been very positive. The seat is one of the most comfortable lie flats (7L).The food was excellent and the service was friendly and efficient although clearly these women are having a tough time what with 2 weeks of stormy weather,massive holiday crowds, and entitled customers. They really provided what felt like an international level of service. The delays were handled professionally by the gate agents who also have had to had a rough go of it. Entertainment was great and wi-fi was excellent."
245,"✅ Trip Verified | I was trying to fly home to San Diego from the San Antonio airport in Texas, and my experience with American Airlines was an absolute nightmare. First, my flight to Dallas was delayed by six hours, and then it was canceled. I was rescheduled for a new flight, which was also canceled. This happened five times in total. Eventually, I had to book a new flight directly with Delta Airlines just to get home. The final rescheduled flight by American Airlines was also canceled, causing me to miss two days of work. I was stuck in the airport for hours, which was torture. To make matters worse, one of the customer representatives lied about the airplane not being at the airport for one of the canceled flights. Using a flight tracker, I could see that the plane was indeed at the airport, and I could even see it outside the window. This experience was beyond frustrating and unacceptable. Save yourself the trouble and avoid flying with American Airlines at all costs."
246,"✅ Trip Verified |  Received messages for delayed flight multiple times, similar to what I experienced last year when I waited in Los Angeles all day before I asked to be transferred to another flight. Some ratings below are based on my experience last year because it is not yet known for this flight (such as seat comfort)."
247,"Not Verified |   I was scheduled to board the flight at 8.25 and eventually arrive at SFO at 12.50AM. This flight was delayed, causing me to miss the connecting flight to SFO, forcing me to layover at Phoenix for 7 hours and then taking me to San Jose instead at 9:14am the next day, forcing me to be late for work. I would need to take another form of transportation from San Jose to my Destination at SFO at my own expense."
248,✅ Trip Verified |  This review is 5 stars for Giovanni the American Airlines representative who noticed I had been at the airport all day. She asked me this and I explained to her that my flight was delayed several times over to repair a tire and I have been here since 6:20 am and I'm on standby for the red eye flight. Giovanni then insisted on helping me to make sure I could get on the next flight that was at 11:59 pm. After working her magic she was the only one to guarantee me a flight to leave so I could make my connecting flight in Dallas to get to Baltimore. She went above and beyond to assist me and I am extremely grateful for her. I was told that the 11:59 pm flight was full and I was 4th in line for standby initially but Giovanni showed something different. Please hire more caring and attentive people like Giovanni. People just want to make it to their destinations and special occasions without being given the run around. Keep being the star that you were today Giovanni! Thank you tremendously! Again my rating is primarily for Giovanni. Along the way the people I spoke to over the phone and at the airport had good customer service but Giovanni saved the day for me!
249,"✅ Trip Verified | Let’s play a game. Close your eyes. You're at a busy airport waiting for your departure. Static, then an overhead announcement that your flight is delayed because the airlines doesn't have a plane. Which airlines are you on? If you said American, you win! The average flight delay for American is 57 minutes. Here's another number. 18. Today, 18 people on our flight missed their connecting flight from Philadelphia to Athens, also an American flight. We were told ""if you hurry, you'll make it"". Yet none of us did. The two terminals were miles apart. No transportation was offered or provided. And *that* flight left on time. We were rerouted through London and Frankfurt. The American agent told us we'd have plenty of time to make connections but did not factor in clearing customs in Frankfurt. So we missed that flight too, not by a little, by a lot. As I write this I am in Frankfurt with no way to get to Athens until (perhaps) tomorrow. Our tour left without us--everyone who didn't fly American was present and accounted for. Since I don't work for American I have to return to work on time and on schedule. I can't tack a couple days on to this vacation. So, if you have no choice but to fly American, stay home. And American, change your name. Latvian Airlines. Azerbaijan Airlines. Anything but America--you're embarrassing all of us."
250,✅ Trip Verified | NEVER fly American. Our flights were delayed both to our destination and coming home. 99% of the staff are extremely unhelpful if not rude. They do not care to help and say do it through the app or call customer service and they do not help either. Our experience to our destination was absolutely terrible but coming back I was hopeful it was just a bad experience and this would be better…just to have a very similar experience. Again I cannot emphasize enough how unhelpful the staff is and how rude they are. Spend the extra money to fly an airline that you know will care about getting you where you need to be. I’d give a zero overall but this won’t let me.
251,"✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines has the very worst customer service. I booked a flight from Denver to Dublin with a connecting flight in Charlotte. I only had a 35 minute layover so I asked the gate and the flight attendant if this would be a problem. They assured me I would make it. Then we sat on the tarmac in Charlotte for 30 minutes. I ran through the airport to catch my flight but they had already shut the door. Nobody bothered to phone ahead and ask them to hold the door for 2 minutes. Waited in line at customer service to book another flight. They said they could only get me on a flight from Dulles. Spent the night in Charlotte and they flew me to Dulles the next morning. When I got to Dulles, the flight was overbooked and they didn’t have a seat for me. Had to spend the night in Dulles. American would not pay for my hotel stay. They booked me on a 10pm flight the next day. They made no effort to compensate me. Correction, they offered me 2500 miles. I can get more than that by simply applying for a credit card. They haven’t offered to allow me access to the Admiral Club while I wait in the airport for 9 hours. They would not upgrade my seat. Nothing. The short story: I have spent 3 days trying to get to Dublin and I’m still not there."
252,"Not Verified |   Just upset. Again it is delayed. This year already I had 12 trips and 60% got delayed or canceled. I am still with AA because is my company policy, but I will fight to have this changed."
253,"✅ Trip Verified |  They started out delaying our flight at PLC. Then upon arrival to Philadelphia, they delayed our flight four times. I spoke to the customer service desk three times requesting a hotel room and was met with disdain. I was told that we're unable to offer you anything until your flight is canceled. But it was never canceled. Only delayed until they could not offer anyone comfortable accommodations for the night. As time passed, I asked what is the reason for the delay and was told the crew has timed out. So, why would American Airlines and Oneworld Alliance book a flight full of passengers to have us stranded at the airport to sleep on a restaurant bench and/or chair. While the employees of American Airlines stated, ""We are leaving because we don't get paid to stay over and another set of representatives will come to assist you."" (The two reps left the desk with at least 20 ticketed customers standing in line at 2200 in concourse B of the Philadelphia Airport on Saturday, May 18, 2024.) Another representative showed up, but stated she was leaving at 2230. I called customer service around 0100 and was was sent a hotel voucher around 0020, but upon clicking the link it displayed ""No hotel rooms available at the moment."" I rechecked for room availability around 0200, but the hotel stopped check-in at 12 midnight. Needless to say, we spent the night stranded in the airport due to American Airlines poor planning for ticketed customers. I sent a complaint to customer relations and requested a refund or at least something comparable to appease us due to the inconvenience and missed engagements the next day. I was only met with 2500 award points. Where can I possibly flight in the US with 2500 points, but no where other than the restaurant bench we got kicked off of or the chair that I spent the remainder of the night located at Gate B8. Giving me enough points for a flight or a travel voucher wouldn't bankrupt you. Please review all the attachments of delays and a letter from customers relations."
254,"Not Verified |   My review is on the ignorance and the knowledge of the American Airlines staff. A lot of them in the airport and customer care, have no idea and instead of admitting their ignorance or trying to pursue the right process, they give wrong information. I lost my bags due to a missed flight. Although I admit missing the flight is partly my fault, the delays in boarding made me complacent leading to a missed flight. Imagine living in a country with none of your belongings. I missed my international connection and lost my bags due to their ignorance. They told me my bags would reach the final international destination, while it was stuck in PHL. If they had told me it was in PHL, I would have gotten my bags from there. I have never met such incompetent and lazy staff. Of the 10 people I spoke to maybe 2 of them knew what was going on and was able to give me solutions to the problem."
255,"Not Verified |   The absolute worst way to travel. Everything about our experience has been terrible. Our flight was delayed 16 hours and when talking to workers, they were incredibly rude and basically said oh well. It then took us several hours just to get a flight to a destination that we have had planned for months. Several of my classmates have been up since three am and it is currently 10:35. We were then all split up (as a group of 20) to go to different locations (Philadelphia, Boston, new jersey, Chicago). Once my mom, me, and two other students got our ticket, the lady told us that the boarding process had already started, so we had to rush to our next plane. They gave us two meal vouchers each, but several of them were expired. Once I arrived in Charlotte, the team members continued to be rude! A lady did not speak English and she was reprimanded for boarding with group 8, even though her ticket said group 8. Once on the plane, I sat next to a lady who told me that when she arrived at the airport, she was told that she had canceled her flight and then she had to start her ticket process all over. Once I arrived in the Boston airport, we were told that we were lied to by Orlando American airlines about a hotel voucher being booked for us when we were sent to a completely different state. We have now been waiting for over an hour for a hotel that was supposed to be booked several hours ago. When we asked the front desk, the lady continued to be on her phone while not even answering us when we asked what hotels were around when we were willing to pay with our own money, for a hotel. While waiting, a lady came up with a broken suitcase and all five members at the desk sat there, several of them on their phones, while she had a suitcase with a broken wheel. They barely moved while she had to pick up the suitcase to show them. I do not understand how not a single person has done the right thing. Everyone is completely rude in the process, even though they were the ones who messed up. I am never using American Airlines again. They have ruined a trip planned out a year in advance."
256,"✅ Trip Verified |  We are traveling with a new born baby and asked the gate attendant to allow us to board earlier so we can properly bit away stroller and baby bags. Gate agent by the name of HP declined the request. When I asked him about hospitality and humanity, HP threatened to not allow us to board at all. HP was the only name this employee provided me with. He said that HP was all I needed to know. Two years ago I stopped flying American after becoming a Platinum member and instead started flying Southwest. I am unsure why I allowed my wife to purchase tickets with American."
257,"✅ Trip Verified |   AA has the worst customer service of any business I have ever interacted with. They cancelled one leg of my flight while I was at the airport. Offered me future travel credit because they could not rebook me same day. The advice the gate agent gave me was to ""drive"". And gave me an 800 number to call. I rented a car, called the number, and had the immense displeasure of speaking to a manager who asked me how I got the number and told me she could not reimburse me for the rental, could not refund my canceled flight and offered her advice of ""use the website"". So even though I was told to call the number and now my husband is driving a rental to try and get us to our connecting airport in time for the next flight she said she cannot do anything to help me. Now that I have looked at their website it is equally as helpful as destiny. I would love to talk to someone from AA who actually cares about people, if such a person is even employed there. If I could leave a 0/10 I would"
258,"✅ Trip Verified | My flight going to NY was fine. But my return from JFK to CDG was awful. This is due to reduced seat pitch (31"") and repeated negligence from the crew, especially 2 hostesses. They kept complaining about the passengers and just wanted to serve the meal and turn the lights off.. The a/c was freezing cold and the air draft was strong. I asked 4 times to increase the temperature. It was actually hot for 10' (28° C probably) and then went back down to 12/13°C. The hostess then said she could not do anything about it. The result is I got a cold and a sore throat. The special meal I requested was not available, and it was the same for many passengers around me. The pasta was hard and disgusting. People around me barely touched it. The service was expedited. The food cart got probably damaged because it was hitting the passengers' seats regularly. The wifi was not working correctly."
259,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the most horrible experience! American Airlines cancelled our connecting flight to London despite options to still catch our flight using other airlines. Their automated system cancelled our seats and reassigned, sold, upgraded them to someone else before working with us to try to rearrange our flight to make it. This was the first time we were flying first class to treat our kids as a reward for their graduations. This ultimately resulted in losses in excess in the cost of the flight tickets that we now have to fight them to get compensated. Buyer beware of American Airlines!"
260,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas Fort Worth to San Francisco onboard their Airbus A321. My previous flight with American was good but I couldn't find the ""punch"" factor that made American Airlines special. This time, I was surprised that American Airlines had become so excellent. Check-in at DFW was done in a very fast manner, and maybe because I arrived way too early, I experienced 6 gate changes - from A16, then B7, B9, B11, C29, then C12 (thank Goodness DFW had a reliable Skylink). However, that was pretty much the end of my moan because once I stepped on the plane for boarding, I was welcomed by a (surprisingly) very energetic set of crews who smiled at and greeted me. I soon proceeded to my seat, 18A, which was pretty much basic with no IFE screen, but it had USB charging ports, universal power sockets, some literature items, and a decent amount of legroom and padding. The cabin, featuring larger overhead bins like the ones in the A321neo, was spacious, comfortable, and in its best condition despite the toilets being inoperable for short flights cruising under 16000ft (we cruised at twice that altitude, so no issues). The Wi-Fi was blazingly fast and the entertainment had plenty of contents that were up-to-date and beautifully laid out. The pretzels and drinks provided on the flight were delicious. Throughout the flight, the cabin crews remained passionate, friendly, cheerful, and lovely. This might be a little bit overboard of me to say, but the crews of this flight were on par with the Japan Airlines and Starlux Airlines crews that I met. We took off from DFW an hour behind schedule due to a changing traffic flow control, and landed at SFO just 25-ish minutes behind schedule, allowing me plenty of time to catch my connecting flight. American has continued to surprise me for the better, and as an AAdvantage member, this flight affirms my loyalty and love towards them."
261,"✅ Trip Verified |  I'm having a terrible experience. I bought tickets from SCL to Montego bay which had a stop on Miami. We were supposed to depart at 21:55. The flight was delayed until 23:00, and later once again delayed until 00:00. At 00:30 with no other information we Are informed that the flight is cancelled due to maintenance. AA got us meal vouchers to use at the airport and moved us to a hotel in Santiago. They moved us by bus at 2:00 am while only one bus was making the round trip to pick us all.. we waited hours at -1°C with no shelter. Next day, with no notice whatsoever to me AA picked up everybody BUT me from the hotel to the airport at 14:30. I had to go by myself by uber at 15:00. At the AA counter there were only 2 people working and the whole group of the cancelled flight had to wait in line until 18:30 The rescheduled flight was supposed to fly at 19:20 now.. it was a few minutes delayed. At the counter and because they were in a hurry, they didn't arranged my connection flight to montego bay but only saw that i could get to miami and ""they will help you there"" At an AA counter in Miami they put me in a flight to Montego bay that leaves at 8:00 -  the flight was overbooked. Now they put me in a waiting list for the next flight but with no certainty that i will make the flight, So far i have lost 2 days of my honeymoon vacation, spent 2 taxi fares, had had a couple meals to survive and have no idea when and if i am going to get to Jamaica finally. The official response of AmericanAir is: ""As a token of our apology, I have credited miles to your AAdvantage® account"" which they added to an account that is not mine by mistake. Meanwhile I'm spending my honeymoon and work leave at airports pushed from line to line with no notice of arriving at my destination. I'm very, very upset and disappointed. Update: they assigned me to another waiting list at a flight to Montego bay at 11:00 am and with no surprise to me, again overbooked. Later they assured me seats at a flight at 18:50 but now destination Kingston ""best i can do"" And when i thought i could finally get to Jamaica, the flight was delayed and now canceled until tomorrow 5 am ... 3 days vacation wasted on airport lines (not to mention lost reservations, no access to my checked baggage, no shower) and @AmericanAir haven't even said sorry."
262,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked 5 tickets on American Airlines. Two were 1st class and three were Economy with additional charges for the premium seating. The initial leg of our flight to Charlotte was cancelled due to mechanical problems. Originally, while we were already boarded, they announced that the flight was not going to take off, but they had no idea on what the resolution would be. When we deboarded the plane, American told us there was no way they were getting us to Charlotte for our connecting flight, and there were no other flights available. The only resolution the gate agents could give us, was that they would get us to our vacation destination 24 hours later. While we were trying to find better options with the agent, my son found a flight departing out of Washington DC. The agent volunteer to book this for us. I assumed that our original flight charges would be refunded and I would be recharged for the new flight. After several email communications with American, we received $175 for each of the two 1st class tickets, and a $25 flight credit for each of the economy tickets. The difference between the original ticket price and the new flights was over $2000. So far, American has responded to two of my emails, and the second was simply thank you for your comments. They say they have ""world class customer service"" but I can't get anything but canned responses. Our 1st class seats were exchanged for basic economy tickets on United Airlines. and the economy tickets with premium seats were exchanged for basic economy seats also. I understand the premium seating purchases are non-refundable, but I truly believe that if the plane does not fly, I should not be charged for the seats! We also had a $160 baggage charge that would have been covered with our 1st class tickets, and since our new flight departed from an airport 2 hours away, we also had to expense a rental car for $150. American Airlines are taking the stance that since they got us to Cancun, we are not entitled to any more refunds. I also now understand, that if I had just allowed American to cancel my original flight, I would have been fully refunded for the charges, but since their agent booked the flight for me, American feels they are due the entire amount of my fees. Trust me, I have learned a valuable lesson and going forward, I will always rebook my own tickets. And flying American will no longer be my first choice!"
263,"Not Verified | I recently purchased 3 tickets and seats to go to a wedding. I specifically purchased all seats in the same row. My mother is handicap and my daughter will only fly if seated next to me. The flight was rescheduled, and my seats were reassigned. I called and explained the situation to the AA representative. She was nice but would not accommodate my seating. I told her I paid over $120 for specific seats. She let me know I could repurchase the seats, but she could not make the change. It's absolutely insane. Needless to say, my daughter won't fly, so I had to cancel her flight. NO REFUND. Now she is upset and can't go to her cousins wedding. To everyone out there, think twice before choosing American Airlines if you want to sit with your loved ones."
264,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a AA Credit Member. MAY 19, Sunday, my flight was delayed due to some type of crew error. The soonest flight would not arrive until May 20 at 10:00am. Due to having to work I will be unable to make that flight. I asked if there was a way to receive a rental car or travel credit for this flight, and I was told no to both, I also purchased an insured flight with. They would also not be able to refund the flight due to I was able to make the first flight; however the connecting flight was missed due to the delay. I really am disappointed with them and will never be booking with them again, forget the credit card and everything. No accommodations is so crazy to me. I have said my piece just so no one gets this same treatment. Please beware of the accommodations for things that are their fault."
265,"✅ Trip Verified |  Another disappointing experience with AA. Always delayed, staff never helpful and they never attempt to assist you or make your journey better. And that’s on business class."
266,"✅ Trip Verified | I fly AA at least 1x/month on full fare first class tickets between DFW and San Diego and, despite their premium fares which range between $1,200 to $2,200 for round trip first class tickets between the two cities, their service delivery is among the worst: chronically delayed, terrible attitude from reservations to flight crew and one lane excuse after another. Today, the flight was delayed (not weather related and no reason provided whatsoever) and flight attendant told me no food or drinks available by the time she got to my seat (1F). How could that be for a $1,200 ticket? That’s just this trip. Always an issue. The management of this airline appears to be among the most incompetent in the industry."
267,"✅ Trip Verified |  We've all heard the stories of how bad the airlines are: Southwest and Spirit #1 and 2 in that order. Well guess what? American is #3. In every capacity. From customer service, flight reliability, ease of service, AA rewards to ticket credits and so on. The customer service agents are rude and combative. When you ask to speak to a supervisor they tell you no and hang up on you."
268,"✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst airline I have ever entered. They moved my husband’s flight from 3:40 pm to 7 am and did not even send an email or anything to inform him. He had to cancel and fly another airline. They moved my flight from 3:40 pm to 7:49 pm. They kept on moving it without any apologies. They moved my terminal and I had to walk all over the airport just to get to my gate. I tried to complain to customer care but they were so rude. I almost felt like crying. Going back from Seattle to Dallas, they moved my flight from 7:17 to 5 am without any notice. Thankfully, I checked my email and saw it. I have flown on bad airlines but American takes the cake. It is one of the worst experiences I have ever had with a company"
269,"Not Verified | Booked first flight to specifically have ZERO issues to board with my guitar for work. Was given a hard time about overhead space when it was able to fit in the regional airplane. Have done this for MANY MANY flights for work with no issues. This is the first time in the many years I've been traveling and touring that they would give me that hard of a time. Was able to fit it no problem after they gave me attitude about it in the first place. American Airlines used to be one of my favorite airlines to travel up until everything happened with the lockdowns in 2020. It is more than likely that unless I am not traveling with my instrument for work, I will most likely never fly with them again. It is against the law to not allow my instrument to be carried on."
270,✅ Trip Verified | Was supposed to use AA to fly to Baton Rouge for a COLLEGE graduation! Unfortunately I wont be attending because my 1st flight was delayed so much that we were going to miss the connecting flight asked what we could do even asked if the plane could be delayed (more than just myself were going to miss the connecting flight). We were told that couldn’t happen and try rebooking the flight. Wasn’t even possible due to the next available flight be AFTER graduation defeating the purpose of even going. The customer service reps were so nasty and in compassionate! And the “request” for a refund is just dumb! So all in all 0/10 would definitely NOT recommend Airline FROM HELL. Let’s not forget that sent me an email at 6:17 telling me the flight was changed to 6:27! No indication that the flight was delayed or anything which I didn’t find out till I got to the airport. 
271,Not Verified |   Horrible! Every other airline took off. American has such a bad record. Plane has been delayed from 1030 until 630. Horrible customer service told me to go home to Sarasota instead of asking me if I live here! 
272,"Not Verified |   Terrible company, cannot emphasize this enough. Complete waste of time and money. Vacation ruined. Plane was late, staff is rude, plane is dirty. Plane was too late for connecting flight, compensation? Nothing. My next flight is full so I’m out of luck. Terrible company. Do not use."
273,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seats bought and paid for on December 5, 2023 for Business Class, lie flat seats for out 50th anniversary splurge to Europe with confirmed seats. We were ""downgraded"" at the gate to allow other passengers to sit in our seats while we were pushed back to Premium economy with an offer of $600.00 flight credit. What in the world makes this ok? After trying to make contact with American Airlines, all I get are robot responses. American Airlines employees at the gate absolutely ruined our mindset for was to be a special trip. We arrived 5 hours early for this flight, checked in with TSA and were waiting in the lounge where my boarding pass was again scanned and reprinted with our assigned lie flat seats. Since my boarding pass had 3H, that is where I went and then asked an attendant what was happening. The guy sitting in my seat thought it was quite funny. I was sent back up the gate where I found my wife had been detained earlier and told to wait until the plane was boarded! Why were our seats given away? Who were our seats given to and why? American Airlines ruined our trip!  Seated instead against our wills Seats in row 14! I tried American airlines several times with not result other than canned ""thank you for submitting"" I am now trying Iberia and British Airways for a refund or full fare First Class to destination of our choice. By the way, all the other flights on this trip on actual Iberia planes was fantastic!"
274,"Not Verified |   Yesterday, I traveled from Doha to Philadelphia on May 14th, 2024. While I appreciated the hard work of the American Airline cabin crew, I encountered an issue regarding access to drinking water. When I raised the concern, I was met with dismissiveness, prompting me to report the incident to the supervisor. Later, I overheard the crew mocking my complaint, highlighting a need for improved customer service training. Airlines should prioritize respectful and attentive care for passengers."
275,"Not Verified | Don't use this airline if you want to make it to your destination on time, they also have terrible service. Most uncomfortable flight, you'll ever sit on. They will lie to you or tell you nothing if you're going to miss a Connecting flight. End, forget about any help if you are going to miss it. I highly suggest you go elsewhere."
276,"✅ Trip Verified |  First of all there isn’t enough space to describe how bad I feel on this page. We booked this flight 5/6 weeks ago to Yellow stone national park. Rental car booked, hotels booked, baby sitter paid for and booked along with a dog sitter. And vacation hours used up. And 9 hours before wheels up we get a notification that our flight has been cancelled. Zero remorse from the caller who we reached out to and absolutely zero try from them to get us on a flight. I don’t know how AA is still in business with the absolute poor customer service. I would rather rent a car and drive to a destination than fly with this awful company. And on top of that we are expected to wait 7 days for a return on our money that they took immediately upon pushing the book button on their app. I truly hope someone sees this review and actually tries to do better. But knowing big business care very little about their customers I would think I’m wanting something that will never happen. For the love of God if someone is looking to fly somewhere do not book with AA! Let my experience save you a heartache."
277,"Not Verified | My flight New Orleans to Dallas was delayed so I missed my connection flight to Helsinki. Then it took AA 2.5 hours to find a new itinerary for me. That new itinerary was going to be Dallas - Dublin, Dublin to Helsinki and Helsinki to Vilnius, which added 15 more hours to my 20 hr trip and made me spend a night at Helsinki, and the airline didn't even pay for the hotel. They call themselves American but the service they provide is awful and NOT American at all."
278,"✅ Trip Verified |  A whole day of flight delays. Delayed 90 mins from ARA to DFW. Missed my connecting flight, but rebooked me for another flight that was 4 hrs away from my original departure time from DFW. Received numerous text messages about my departing flight gate change - the gate changed 4 times. Finally caught my rebooked, delayed flight 7 hrs later just to sit on the plane for another 40 mins to an hour before departing. Seriously, who can make this up? I honestly thought there were only two poverty airlines, but AA is right there with them. I wouldn’t recommend this airline unless you had to choose between the other two terrible airlines that somehow still exists. And even then, don’t make plans because you’ll be traveling for over 10 to 15 hours for an hour and a half flight."
279,"Not Verified |   This airline had the worst customer service, all of the flight attendants and workers were extremely rude, and borderline verbally harassed me because I did not return his ""hello"" quick enough. He then asked if I knew how to speak because only people who could talk were allowed on the plane. I was very offended and walked past trying to play it off as funny, then he continued to chirp at me as I walked onto the boarding deck. Not only did out first flight get delayed because they ""overfueled"" the plane, then out second flight got delayed for ""mechanical issues"" and then continued to keep us stranded on the plane with no AC. I will never fly this airline again. I don't know if it is a problem with DFW or American Airlines but I have never felt so uncomfortable flying in my entire life."
280,"✅ Trip Verified | They delayed the flight several times, then right before entering the plane they took away mine and several other passengers’ carry-on, saying that there was no room left inside the plane. Then when I arrived at Fort Lauderdale airport they didn't give me my carry-on. They lost it. Absolutely unorganized work, poor service, uncomfortable plane and these small seats for $300, no free Wi-Fi."
281,"Not Verified |   Horrible flight which I had today on flight 104 from New York to London Heathrow after having a cancelled flight, and I don't even have my luggage yet. Disrespectful team unorganized, never flying again with American Airlines."
282,"✅ Trip Verified | Check-in at SJU was nice and easy. No fast track, though. First flight was delayed by 90 minutes because of thunderstorm in SJU. Cabin crew, food, drinks as well as entertainment were good in the first flight. I had to run in CLT to make the connection. I made it, my luggage did not. I was pleasantly surprised when arriving in MSY I got an email to make arrrangements online to get my baggage delivered, so I did not have to wait to make the claim in person as it was late. Things to improve: food in the CLT-MSY was quite basic: a drink and a pack of crisps. At least a sandwich in a 2 hour flight would make it better. Also, I could not enter any VIP lounge. Flying business I took it for granted, as this is a common policy in Europe. My luggage was delivered to my hotel 24 hours later, so not too bad. Still, I would fly with them again."
283,"Not Verified |   Flight from Los Angeles to London. The space for your legs and general movement is on par with a cheap domestic flight! A 14-hour journey in these conditions is torture, not pleasure! Flug von Los Angeles nach London. Der Platz für die Beine und allgemein für die Bewegung liegt auf dem Niveau eines günstigen Inlandsfluges! Eine 14-stündige Fahrt unter diesen Bedingungen ist eine Qual und kein Vergnügen!"
284,✅ Trip Verified |  Customer service at the Savannah airport with American Airlines are absolutely unprofessional and rude to travelers. The lady that was helping me caused me to miss my flight and she wouldn’t even accommodate to me on a flight that would be convenient for me. She was training and was very slow at what she was doing on her computer. I had never experienced something this terrible with an airline and never expected this from American Airlines
285,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our first leg of the trip was delayed by American arriving late into HHH so our take off was delayed. Due to this our connection in Clt to Philadelphia was missed. A trip that should have taken 3 hours, took 15 hours. The delays in and out of Charlotte airport on American are despicable! This same delay has an entire plane of people running to catch connections that could have been made but instead it’s “no big deal” to rebook 100 people. I’ll never fly American Airlines again."
286,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am flying with American Airlines  today. I have had hands down the worst experience of my life. The employees are untrained, lack manners and basic knowledge required to preform their job duties. I ask to be placed on stand by for a flight before my current scheduled. I was sent back and forth between 7 different people and no one able to help me. I cannot be placed on stand by from the app, web, ticket counter, agent counter, reservation line or customer service line. So how do you expect customers to utilize stand by to ease travel? There is absolutely no way to get help or guidance. My already stressful day was made 100x worse by American Airlines useless employees. I expect more from American Airlines. I have no intention of flying with you again and will plan on sending my family, friends and clients to a different an airline with employees that are helpful and competent. American Airlines is a disgrace to the travel industry."
287,✅ Trip Verified |  6 hours of delay on our flight and airport staff had absolutely no answers as to why the flight was delayed until 2am. They were just standing there twiddling their thumbs as passengers who have been waiting for nearly 9 hours become increasingly frustrated staring at the plane we’re supposed to be on. After the delay announcement it took over an hour to finally learn why when a supervisor had come over- they didn't have a flight crew. Seems like the most massive oversight on their part which is why you will never ever catch me on another American flight- I’d literally rather walk to my destination.
288,✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible. Changes the departure time 9 times and the gate assignment changes 5 times. At the time of this writing the flight is 14 hours delayed. I doubt it will actually leave. Their staff has been rude at times too. Don’t fly American.
289,"Not Verified |   Had a family medical emergency, had to delay out going flight. My sister and I both were traveling together and both purchased the same economy tickets. She got lucky and got a very nice employee who gladly changed her outgoing flight, no problems, no proof of emergency requested and no additional fees paid! I however was not so lucky, I was told I had to have mu outgoing flight cancelled, and purchased a completely new outgoing flight, so I paid for two outgoing flights. Was informed that I would have to supply a letter from the hospital of the medical emergency, in order to receive a refund of the first outgoing ticket purchased, which I did. After doing everything asked, I was denied a refund...... stating due to the ticket being an economy class! Just sad that this is how American Airlines treats people, I get rules are rules, but your employees don't follow them! This will never ever make since to me, and I plan on never ever flying with AA again in my life, they don't deserve any of my hard earned money. This was a once in a life time trip for me and I cost me more than it should have, I'm not a rich person, my measly $550 means more to AA than being fair! Too top it off my carry on bag that I was forced to check was stolen upon arrival! American Airlines is just awful."
290,"✅ Trip Verified |  There is literally no way to talk to an AA employee who can do something about a poor experience. A customer must instead complete a cumbersome on-line form. I submitted such a form and included the information below. At a bare minimum, I am entitled to a refund of the difference between first class and coach, and I should also receive compensation. Instead, all I got was a short form email response that said “sorry” and a $25 credit. Unbelievable. My trip was a disaster for many reasons, including how I was treated by American after the trip. It is clear that American upper management cares only about short term profits and is not focused on the long term or its customers. This is a shortsighted approach and American will pay the price in the end. Is management oblivious to the terrible reputation American has in the marketplace? Many people — including me at this point — simply refuse to fly the airline. And American employees are equally frustrated with the company. Almost without exception, when I related my poor experience, they apologized and said they wish there was something they could do but the company will not allow them to take any action. And almost without exception, they went on voice their serious concerns about how the company is managed. Upper management, wake up! You are headed for disaster unless you alter course. Here is the information I submitted on the form: “Issues with first leg: I received multiple text messages which postponed my original flight multiple times. Weather was a factor but most of the delay was due to mechanical problems, poor planning, and mismanagement. My original flight from SLC to DFW was scheduled to leave at 2:02pm. It was first postponed to 3:01pm. It was then postponed to 4:18pm, then 5:18pm, then 6:32pm, then 7:28pm, then 8:12pm, etc. etc. etc. The flight was finally scheduled to depart at 10:25pm, a full 8.5 hours later than the original departure time. Meanwhile, inexplicably, many other flights left on time or with only short delays. I stood in a quite long line at the SLC airport, I had to be quite aggressive to get a seat on a flight to Dallas that departed at approximately 5:30pm, and I lost my first class seat. As an aside, a long line should have been unnecessary, but there were only AA agents at one of the AA gates and there were only two agents. Why not more agents at more gates since AA was of course fully aware of the many issues arising? Issues with second leg: Here is my updated boarding pass for my second leg, Flight 1007: When we landed at DFW, I walked to Gate C6 but when I went to board with my updated boarding pass they told me that I was not on the flight and that I had been rebooked on another earlier flight that had already departed a short time before! Why didn’t anybody tell me? I could have made that flight if I had only known. Again, being somewhat aggressive, I was able to get a ticket on Flight 1007 which they had told me was full. However, again, I lost my first class seat. Issues with luggage: When I finally arrived in New Orleans, it took at least 45 minutes for baggage to start being loaded onto the carousel. And after waiting for all the luggage to come through, which also took significant time, I realized that both my bags had been lost. I then needed to go to the AA baggage claim office, wait in a long line there, & answer many questions. They eventually told me that my bags never left SLC. Etc."
291,"Not Verified |   I have never seen so many people left hanging on standby. We were pushed on standby for 3 flights, no sleep, no suit case, same clothes for 1.5 days. The issue of people trying to find gate changes was unreal. We had 2 gate changes on the 3 standbys. Not to mention the gate agents, we had one in Miami named Alex he was very helpful otherwise no one. As for the customer service in the airport all were very rude. It is all about them not the customer. I have to say these poor agents put up with what the executives plan, you executives make their jobs unbearable. Not sure how anyone can work there under all these circumstances. 2 hour delay with a plane in Bahamas, 40 minutes on the tarmac in Miami and of course over a mile long line in customs due to Americans number of standby flights. by this time we missed our 9 PM flight and again stood in line at American from 8:30 until 12:30 PM to be put on standby at 6 AM the next morning to Charlotte. We made the 6 AM flight then on stand by for three times there. no sleep, no suit case, same clothes. Finally we got on a 3:30 flight to Minneapolis. As we were on my sister in law went to her seat and then was hauled back to the door to get off. Someone was in her seat. Her husband had enough he said 2 people were listed after us on standby and we were told they go by the list so the ones behind us on here need to get off. They ended up taking off the lady who seat in her seat which did not have a ticket just a standby stub. We will never use American again, and I would suggest to anyone out there fly Delta at least they treat you nice and get you back on a flight! "
292,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was traveling to New Orleans from Greenville via Charlotte by American Airlines. There was a 1.5 hour transit at Charlotte Douglas Airport, but the flight made delay at Greenville Airport. So, in transit I was almost running to catch the flight to New Orleans. Ground Staff were helpful to keep the aeroplane waiting for few more minutes for the transit passengers. Cabin crews were good in this particular flight. Aircraft was good. Very light snacks was provided."
293,"✅ Trip Verified |  I often travel by American Airlines while in the USA. It offers very average service. Ground staff are sometimes good, but many cases they are bad in manner, especially with foreigners. Cabin crew were good in this particular flight. Aircraft was good. Very light snacks was provided."
294,✅ Trip Verified |  Absolute waste of money. Landed stating medical emergency and fact is something else. Stuck us for 24 hours at Madrid and also connecting flight got after another 24 hours.
295,"✅ Trip Verified |  Phoenix to Mexico City flight was actually good. Departed & arrived on-time. Purchasing food onboard was somehow complicated since you have to upload your credit card details in their app which I find unsafe, this is just me though. A slightly bigger meal could have been served instead of just a small pack of biscuit in this three-hour international flight."
296,"✅ Trip Verified |  I will never fly American Airlines again. The first flight they wouldn’t announce my 9yr old sons allergy and the person next to me pulled out a bag of peanuts. Luckily, I was right there to stop her and she was very understanding. My 10 yr old son tripped getting off of the first flight and twisted his ankle which was no one’s fault, but it brings me to my disastrous connecting flight in charlotte. This flight was an 11pm flight and they had my 2 sons and myself in all different locations- one of which, as I already stated, has life threatening allergies so severe that he has had multiple anaphylactic reactions just from touching things that contain oils of peanuts and tree nuts, and the other now hopping around due to the twisted ankle. I explained the situation and the First Lady at the desk and she basically told me that she had no idea how to help and to come back when the other lady showed up. The other lady showed up and the First Lady made me go back to the end of the line to speak with her. Also, this was during pre-boarding and meant I would miss my opportunity to get on and wipe everything down for my allergic son. So I chose to go on and hope the attendants could help. Lady #1 gave me a ridiculous amount of grief pre-boarding and While I was in the middle of speaking with her, she started saying “ok bye. I said bye” in a condescending tone.  The flight attendants were all very nice, but were very clear that the policy stated that they could not assist at all in helping me sit with my two kids on this late flight- which, if this is a company policy as it sounds, is complete rubbish. Children should not be separated from their parents, especially on an 11pm flight and with the already stated issues going on. It put me in a position to have to plead with people and explain this very emotional and stressful issue multiple times, while in the middle of the chaotic boarding process with everyone listening. Then when we got off the flight in Boston, I went to get a chair to push my son with the twisted ankle on and the man told me I couldn’t take it… so my 10 year old had to hop all the way to the baggage claim and I found him a stray one there. To American Airlines- if you are not willing to announce peanut allergies on your flight and to tell people that they can’t eat their peanuts/tree nuts when a child with severe allergies is at risk, what gives you the right to separate them from the person who will protect them. Horrible service."
297,Not Verified |   American Airlines is probably the worst airline to fly on and 20 minutes wifi only. When we can go on Delta and get pretty much 2 hours of wifi time and even still we can regenerate a new url to get another 2 hours. AA needs to get with the tines and get with the program. All 6 of the passengers I flew with (some family) are in mutual agreement that this airline is pretty pathetic just on the situation of wifi usage.  Come on AA is that good business? 
298,"Not Verified |   American Airlines is by far the worst airline I have flown on. They abandoned me and my family at JFK after an 8 hour flight, which they delayed twice and changed the gate of three times. After all that they had the worst customer service, basically telling us we couldn’t make the flight we were connecting to, even though it didn’t leave for another almost half hour, and telling us we had to find a way to get from JFK to LaGuardia, to catch a 11:30 flight the next day. Never fly American."
299,"Not Verified |   I'm writing this for my wife. She has been stranded by American for 18 hours now, and counting. Two cancellations, and then delays. The plane she's waiting on now was late leaving Austin, and is delayed about 3 hours so far. We have to decide if she's just going to a hotel, and I have to drive to Dallas to pick her up. We are about to give up on the idea of American getting her out of DFW at all. We haven't even begun to talk to them about a refund, but I can imagine how that's going to go. Terrible company. Never fly with them. They have tortured her. She's been awake at the airport for 18 hours now, and she is overwhelmed with exhaustion. Don't let this happen to you. Don't fly American."
300,✅ Trip Verified |  Traveling American Airlines today has been an awful experience and still is. I boarded this morning at 7:30 AM and was supposed to arrive at 11:30 but did not arrive until 4:00PM. Was supposed to return to Philadelphia from Dallas the same day and was supposed to leave at 7PM and here it is 12:30AM and I am so waiting.
301,"Not Verified |   Not a fan of AA during my most recent trip. I was traveling with a tour group, and our group was placed in a separate line to check our luggage. Only 1 person was dedicated to taking care of our group, and it took too long to check us in, so 5 of us missed our flight. There were about 15 other people not part of our group who also missed the flight thanks to the long TSA lines. Our flight departed at 6, and we got there at 5:55. Plane was still there, but they wouldn't let us board. Lesson learned that we needed to be there earlier, but not awesome that they wouldn't wait a few more minutes knowing there were so many people who missed the flight. Just know they close their gates 15-30 min prior to departure time. Our next connecting flight was 30 min late ... so it's not ok for the customer to be 10 min late thanks to their long lines, but it's ok if they run late. "
302,"✅ Trip Verified | There is something fishy going on with American Airlines. We were scheduled to fly home from Aruba, April 11th. We received an email stating that this flight was cancelled. The flight was scheduled for for 5:09 pm. We received the cancellation email at 10:55 am. The weather in Aruba was beautiful so I checked the weather in Charlotte, again the weather did not seem to be an issue. I checked the departure data for Charlotte on that day and only 2% of the flights were cancelled. I suspect it wasn't really a weather delay but some other issue and they are blaming it on weather so that they do not have to compensate passengers. They rebooked our flight for the next day and of course that flight was delayed. We had to run thru the Miami airport from gate D1 to gate D53 to make our connecting flight to Knoxville, Tn. We barely made it and were offered no help. The airline was well aware that the flight was late and that people making connections would be having issues. The flight attendants asked all passengers not making a connecting flight to stay in there seats and let the connecting flight passengers deboard first. Why couldn't they just ask the connecting flights to wait 10-15 minutes and give people a chance to get to their gates? Really disappointed in American."
303,"Not Verified |  This is my 2nd trip on American. Both trips have experienced flight delays. The first time I missed my ride home from the airport, which I'd already paid for (Greyhound), so I had to pay another $100 for an Uber. 2 years later, and on my current trip the first flight was delayed for an hour, meaning I would miss my connection. The agent put me on standby for another flight, which ended up being full so I got bumped. They put me on standby again and won't guarantee I'll get on the next flight. I would say I'll never fly American again, but I might not have a choice because I only have a small regional airport near home (if you consider an hour drive ""close""). The only airline I've had more problems with was Spirit, and Spirit sets the bar really low."
304,"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible company. They changed the gate three times, you had to run everywhere in the airport. They have zero organization, one big screen, and only a small line for information. You paid for an extra seat and they gave you a bad seat in exchange. American Airlines already has problems with flights and incidents, but when you see the service on the ground, it's exactly the same."
305,"✅ Trip Verified |  I try to give the benefit of doubt to American airlines because things happen in life, but flight after flight delays, cancelation, no accommodation, understaff, no pilot, the list goes on. Worst airline ever. Record cancellations in the last four years. "
306,"✅ Trip Verified |   A disastrous experience. My recent encounter with American Airlines has left me utterly disappointed and frustrated. From start to finish, the experience was marred by a complete lack of care and professionalism, particularly exemplified by staff at the counter, whose rudeness was unparalleled. First and foremost, our flight was delayed not just once or twice, but a staggering five times. This not only disrupted my plans but also caused me to miss a crucial business meeting that I had traveled for. Despite explaining the urgency of my situation to the staff, he seemed indifferent and unapologetic, displaying a shocking level of disregard for customer concerns. To add insult to injury, the ordeal didn't end there. Due to the repeated delays, I inevitably missed my return flight as well. In what should have been a straightforward journey, American Airlines managed to turn it into a logistical nightmare. What truly astounds me is the blatant apathy displayed by American Airlines towards their customers. Despite multiple instances of inconvenience and dissatisfaction, there was no semblance of empathy or effort to rectify the situation. It's disheartening to see a company prioritize profits over the well-being and satisfaction of its patrons. In conclusion, my advice to anyone considering American Airlines is simple: stay away. The combination of abysmal customer service, frequent delays, and a lack of accountability make for an experience that is best avoided at all costs. Until significant improvements are made, I will be taking my business elsewhere, and I strongly urge others to do the same."
307,"Not Verified |   Because I had left my wallet, I could not proceed with ticking at the airport. Ms. Renata helped me to proceed with my ticketing so I could take the plane from Dallas to Phoenix on April 5th. I am grateful for Ms. Renata, and I recommend that she be recognized as the best employee. "
308,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight was scheduled for 5 am, I received a text at 11.23 pm. the night before telling me the flight was delayed 16 minutes. No big deal. Needless to say, the flight didn't leave at 5.16 am. The flight started boarding at 5.25ish, now I will miss my connecting flight due to a very short transfer time to begin with. I asked the person at the flight desk what to do, I was told to figure it out in Phoenix. Let it be known, I'm not a person that flies a lot  nor do I know Phoenix airport well. I walk to the main desk to try to reschedule my flight. Long story short, I received zero help from anyone working for American Airlines. I was told ""I CAN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU "". I will never fly American again as I am out 1200 dollars for a first class ticket. Americans First Class isn't all that. Same seats as the rest of the plane, dinner was in a box and Wi-Fi sucks. Also, they are always short on overhead storage due to the tiny planes. If you don't fly First Class or Comfort you will most likely have to check your carry on. I could go on, but why! Story told, terrible experience twice in a row."
309,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience ever with an airline. We started off pretty good we travel with a service dog so they were very nice about it. From our departure we were delayed so knowing this the airline knew we weren’t going to make it for the connection flight either way they let us depart. Once in Miami it took us awhile to get off the plane. Most of us were rushing because we had to take another plane. It didn’t matter because there was a never ending line to go through passport control same with the check point so we were missing the connection flights regardless. I don’t understand why American Airlines makes you get your luggage at your arrival in Miami and then makes you drop up right before the check point I never had to do such thing with other airlines this was such a waste of time knowing the time frame we had for the connection was very short so thanks AA for making things more complicated. So after missing our flight we ended up rebooking. They didn’t have anything to offer because they had tons of people waiting to be reseat from different flights so seems like the airline have a problem with schedules because it was more than one flight with the same issue. We ended up on a standby list hoping to get out of the airport the next day by 7 am. They didn’t offer a hotel room or food because according to them this wasn’t the airline’s fault it was an “air traffic issue” they also said it was because the bad weather up north which wasn’t true. After all the next day at 7 am we showed up at the counter hoping to find a seat in this airplane we found out we were 45 people waiting to be reseated. We didn’t get a seat in that flight so we had to talk to an agent and put us first on the next waiting list. We finally got to the 8 am JFK flight and they finally let us depart after such a long day of traveling. Honestly I was expecting better service from this airline but unfortunately it wasn’t a good experience, hopefully I won’t use them again. Very disappointed"
310,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travel all the time taking my 3 grandsons. I travel either Alaska Airlines or Delta Airlines and never in 30 years have had a problem. We travel 4 to 5 times a year. Seattle was great everything went smooth. I get into key West and they sent my bag to Saint louis, even though we changed planes in Dallas Texas. That was a inconvenient but I wasn't mad yet. The really kicked back laid back staff at the counter said it was arriving 4 hours later (at 7pm) and they would have it delivered. Not at all. I spent hour the next day hunting it down. Loosing a bag happens, not caring is not acceptable."
311,"Not Verified | I am writing this review and not much good to be said about it. Flight one from Charlotte to Montego Bay was subpar. Unable to connect to the WiFi. They had SEVERAL people on standby trying to get us to change flights. Trying to check in for our flight home. We initially upgraded our tickets for row 9. When checking in they changed us to row 14 then trying to upgrade AGAIN to first class they had the seats but the change would not go through on their app. We then get a message 30 minutes before we were due to leave the resort so we had already checked out of the resort but our flight was canceled. No flights were left available to fly into Charlotte and be at the airport on time. Nothing available the following day. We had to book a flight 2 days after we were supposed to be home. Meaning extremely important meetings we had to be on for work. Canceled Drs appts and got charged late cancelation fees. No upgrades offer for the inconvenience and we then had to pay another $1000 to stay here since AA had no flights available. So we are now out nearly $1500 for room stay, canceled appointments, PTO used for work and had to PAY to upgrade our seats. Do not fly AA as this is the 2nd time they cancelled a flight on us."
312,Not Verified |   Flight from St Thomas to Philly was delayed causing us to miss connecting flight from Philadelphia to Boston. Once on plane in Philadelphia it was determined we didn’t have enough fuel so headed back to get fuel. Now we have missed our shuttle to the airport which will certainly cost us stupid money because the shuttle is no longer running. We still have a three hour drive to maine. Haven’t eaten since 2:00 in St Thomas as and it is 11:46 pm. And we haven’t left Philly yet. Now we may not even fly because of wind situation. Worst flying experience yet. Unbelievable
313,"Not Verified |   Was shocked at the flight attendant’s attitude. We were on our flight back from New York to London Heathrow after spending a weekend away for our first wedding anniversary. The staff were passing out the meals and, by the time the attendant on our side reached maybe three rows in-front before us, the flight attendant started just throwing meals on peoples tables and not asking if they wanted chicken or pasta. My husband and I assumed they had none left and just accepted, however we heard the next side being given the option of chicken or pasta. My husband very kindly asked Raul why we were not given a choice. His response, in an extremely blunt tone “you don’t get a choice” which completely stunned us. My husband then, again politely mentioned about the next row and he then went uncaringly ‘well we get a number for each side’ We understand this however the attitude was unnecessary and felt like a completely power move. He got my husband a pasta from the other side, he thanked the FA to which he sarcastic went “yeah”. I thought it was incredibly rude, unnecessary and just put us both in a bit of a blue mood for the rest of the flight. We had been on our wedding anniversary, just because we are at the very back of the plane does not mean we do not deserve service. I will not be flying with them again. This FA continued to be unfriendly for the rest of the trip and made me feel incredibly uncomfortable."
314,"✅ Trip Verified |  A quick roundtrip this weekend DCA-SLC. Not! Four flights total. Two were deplaned for hours while American searched for other planes that weren’t defective. On the way out they found one at 5:30 am the next day, 18 hours late. Book me on another carrier with well-maintained aircraft? Nope. Clear skies, awful planes. Horrible booking site. Nearly useless app. The perfect storm; no actual storm necessary."
315,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is for flight AA 2053 from SAT to PHX on 24 Mar 2024. The cabin and seating were filthy. Every tray I opened or surface I touched was either grimy from many hands or left with crumbs from a prior snack. I'd expect attention to the cleanliness of the whole customer seating area, but especially first class where you are paying extra for creature comforts and service."
316,"✅ Trip Verified | Never Flying American Airlines again! We booked our flights (for end March 30th) in October so my family could sit together. We paid extra money so we would not have to split up and the day before our flight we got put on standby. Our family got split up, and the flight crew got mad when we tried to switch seats as we boarded (we decided me and my daughter would swap to different seats considering my five year old daughter was placed next to a stranger). They were very rude to us and thankfully one of the passengers switched for my daughter's sake. Then moments before takeoff we were informed not all of the bags had made it on and the company forced them to take off."
317,"Not Verified |  I was flying from Kona, HI to Phoenix, AZ on 3-27-24 Flight AA60. I arrived at the Kona airport 2 hrs prior to my flight and stood in a very long line at the ticketing counter where one employee was working. I had already purchased my checked bag through the app so I thought about going to the counter and asking for my baggage tag but did not want to be disrespectful of all of the people in front of me, so I stood in the long line. By the time I got up to the counter, it was about 40 minutes to my flight, and I was denied the ability to check my bag. I assured the attendant that I was there in plenty of time, but that the line was long, and even asked that they check cameras to verify. I was told that he is not going to put my luggage onto this flight regardless of me being here on time because I didn’t make it to the counter in time. His only resolution was to rebook on a later flight and stated that I would have to buy a whole new ticket to even get on it. When I protested, the agent rolled his eyes, smirked, slammed my ID on the counter face down, and walked away while I was still speaking. I was with two friends and we were in utter shock of the disrespect displayed by the employee. I asked for a manager, but she refused to come over. I needed to make this flight so I could get home for work, so I had to leave my suitcase on HI. These agents laughed at me and told me “good luck”. Once I arrived home, I called American Airlines to report this, but was told by the representative and the supervisor to call American Airlines cargo to pay and have my suitcase shipped, because they would do nothing about this. Even though I protested because I thought this was outrageous, I called American Airlines cargo. AA Cargo stated “I don’t know why representatives continue to send customers to us… we will only work with businesses, not passengers for their personal luggage. I got off the phone with them and wondered why “the right hand doesn’t know what the left-hand is doing“ at American Airlines, and still sat with no resolve of getting my luggage from Hawaii to Phoenix. My only option was to email a complaint because American Airlines will not even take complaints by phone and attempt to help customers. I am an American Airlines advantage member and this represents American Airlines and Kona airport terribly as being absolutely no help and disrespectful to their patrons. And I am now back home without any of my belongings to no fault of my own with no resolution to this horrific experience offered by American Airlines except their own cargo company (that actually is not an option), and a suggestion to FedEx my 50 pound suitcase for nearly $400.00. Shame on you, American Airlines, for causing this issue in the first place, not accommodating a loyal customer, allowing disrespect to happen in multiple avenues of your company, blaming me for standing in your long line for too long, and offering no help or resolution to someone who is now out all of their personal belongings all because you did not schedule enough employees at the ticketing counter to work through long lines, and allowed blatant, disrespect, and disregard for customers. Shame on you. With all of the other airline options out there, and many being cheaper than American Airlines, I will not be flying American Airlines anytime soon, and I do not suggest you do, either."
318,"Not Verified |  I had the absolute worst experience with AA. I flew from Sacramento to LAX on AA4929 on 3/14. Preboarding they stated there was no over bin space and my bag needed to be 'courtesy' checked in. I handed over my suitcase like everyone else and expected it to be at the jet bridge. Long story short, AA informs me upon my arrival at LAX that my bag 'must have not made it'.  Mine was the only bag that was left behind because 'it must not have fit under the plane'. Since when is that protocol? Leave a bag behind? I have a 8 pm flight scheduled the following day. I obviously needed my bag. The AA worker stated she 'messaged' the team in SAc to expedite my bag on the 8 am flight. I arrived at LAX waiting for my bag and Sacramento airport said they 'got the message too late'. How does an IM message get delivered late? A new AA lady stated she would send it on the next flight but it was going to sac-phoenix arizona-lax. Then my bag gets stuck in Arizona! This same lady tells me to file a 'late bag claim'. When we go online to do so, it clearly states these claims are not accepted unless your bag has been missing for 5 days? Why advise a customer to do something when they are not even able to do so? I had to pack a whole suitcase of items I bought last minute. My father did not receive my bag until Friday at 7:30 pm when I was in my seat on my way to London- a whole 24 hours late.  It was exhausting working with idiots to get my luggage that should have never been checked in in the first place - so much for the ""courtesy' check-in. My bag was misplaced thanks to American Airlines. I am never flying with them again."
319,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines has horrible policies. I booked a flight with a specific time to get to my destination. American cancelled the flight and put me on a different flight that arrived 2 hours later (missing my appointment). So, I had to book with a different airline to make my appointment. American Airlines apparently has a policy that they will not refund your flight even when they change it, unless it is by more than 4 hours! So they gave me a credit to use later on another American Airlines flight, expiring in 1 year. I tried multiple times to book another flight, both online and through their app. I even called on the phone and chatted online with agents, trying to use the credit. Every time I tried, I got an error message that the credit could not be found. No one from American would help me use the credit, despite email after email, phone calls, chats, etc. Now the 1 year is up and I will lose the credit. American Airlines has terrible customer service, horrible policies, and cares nothing about their customers. I will never fly American Airlines again!"
320,"✅ Trip Verified |  One of the dirtiest planes I have ever been on. This month I flown on 4 different AA flights, and all the planes were less than that deal when it comes to cleanliness. The last flight though sent me over the edge; when I went to get in my seat there was spilled wine that had not been cleaned up, and crumbs all over the little table and arm rests. Even the guy next to me commented that they must have skipped cleaning this plane."
321,Not Verified |  Worst airline I have ever flown on. We were to fly out Saturday. Flight cancelled but not rebooked until Monday. On Monday flight cancelled after we got to the airport with no warning. Rebooked for Tuesday night 8:30 pm. Tuesday 11pm they canceled the flight until 7:00 am Wednesday. Maintenance problem on plane that they fixed then the flight crew left (watched them walk past all the waiting passengers). American Airlines doesn’t care a bit.
322,"✅ Trip Verified |  My review is for what happened before my international trip with American last month as well as my experience today trying to fly American American booked me double for the same flight. When I saw this on my credit card, I called my bank and they said they would dispute. I also called American and told them about it. The woman with American refunded. However, American also deleted the remaining flight due to bank request without looking at the notes of what happened . I only learned this the night before I was supposed to fly out and ended up having to drive five hours to catch the flight for my job. Two days ago I had booked travel with my flyer miles, and when I went to look at my itinerary, it didn’t exist. American claims that this is because there was an issue with my payment. However, the issue was with their system not accepting the card if the name didn’t match exactly the name on my ticket. I bought the ticket with miles. I was not notified that my ticket was canceled. So after many hours I rebooked, but had to use double frequent flyer points as the rates had gone up. They would not negotiate. The worst part was that I got up at 3 AM this morning and drove to the airport and was at the airport an hour and 10 minutes before the flight was to leave. There were people in line that have been there 90 minutes before the flight was to leave, there was a long line, not enough employees, none of the kiosks were working. Because American could not get their overbooked flight processed in time at least 10 people, myself included were rebooked, and some of these poor older folks were supposed to be leaving on vacation today and had to have it rescheduled for tomorrow. There were no apologies. A woman just kept yelling about how everyone should’ve gotten there earlier. I went ahead and canceled my flight and rebooked on Delta. Because of these multiple mistakes, extremely long customer service times, and the total lack of accountability today, including rudeness to older people who are just trying to go somewhere on vacation, I will never fly this airline again. I fly for business monthly, and even if I have to inconvenience myself to go on another airline, I will not use American. They really need to clean up their act."
323,"Not Verified | American has been the main carrier we’ve used and we are Advantage members. But, today we were horribly disappointed with the American customer service in Charlotte. With many travelers re-routed (due to multiple reasons) lines were very long and American customers service were rude, lazy and overall unpleasant. They actually turned off their computers packed up their belongings and left the counter with at least 100 customers still in line with absolutely no explanation (when we asked “we don’t matter?” the AA employees just shrugged stuck up their nose and said, “we’re leaving”. I can’t do that at my job and expect to still be employed the next day! So, when we got home and our luggage did not make it, we can only assume the same mentality (or lack of) customer service also exists in the luggage department as well. Is it American or is it Charlotte? Or the horrible combination of the two. Only as strong as your weakest leak and right now the chain is broken! Sorry the survey questions don’t address American ground crew because that’s were the problem seems to be."
324,"Not Verified | Honestly, every time I fly AA I am shocked at the level of bad experience I have. Their seats are so uncomfortable. I always way overpay for services never received. You never get the refund you deserve. I took a customer to Costa Rica and they missed their connecting flight and ultimately had to fly Southwest to get home. I've had to do the same thing when traveling home from Houston TX. They are unorganized and ultimately cost you money as if they were this ""elite"" airline. Not even close. I will rather fly Southwest or Spirit, save the money, get much better service, and call it a day. I don't feel like they take good care of their planes either which is scary. They had plane issues both coming and going. That's too much."
325,"✅ Trip Verified |  I've flown with American Airlines numerous times over the years and have generally regarded them as a top-tier airline, offering excellent service and a comfortable flying experience. However, my recent encounter at the airport on March 1st has left a blemish on what I've always considered a reliable choice for air travel. American Airlines has seemingly adopted a new policy where their staff are directed not to assist customers directly unless through the use of the airline's mobile app. This approach felt incredibly impersonal and contrary to the warm service I've come to expect. Observing staff members choosing to wear headphones and dismiss passenger inquiries directly contradicts the essence of customer service. This shift towards a more detached interaction is not only disappointing but signals a worrying trend in their service philosophy. Moreover, my dismay was further compounded when reviewing the safety brochures provided onboard. It appears American Airlines has taken to only labeling their aircraft as ""737,"" omitting any mention of it being a Boeing or the specific variant number. This choice strikes me as a deliberate attempt to obscure the exact model of the aircraft from passengers, perhaps out of embarrassment or a misguided attempt to sidestep potential scrutiny. This lack of transparency is not just a matter of corporate image; it directly impacts passenger safety by not fully informing them about the aircraft they are flying in. Despite these criticisms, it's important to note that my experiences with American Airlines have overwhelmingly been positive, outside of these specific incidents. The quality of their flights, the professionalism of most of their staff, and the overall flying experience remain commendable. It's disheartening to see such an esteemed airline let down by policies that seem to prioritize image over direct human interaction and safety transparency. It is my hope that American Airlines will reconsider these practices. There's immense value in honest communication with passengers and in maintaining the high standard of service that has defined them for years. Addressing these issues would not only enhance their reputation but also reaffirm their commitment to passenger safety and satisfaction."
326,"Not Verified |  The male flight attendant from Miami as he stated is the best, such a funny and sweet person upon arrival stepping onto the flight was very welcoming energy, as all of us have been dealing with the delay of the flight. This was flight 5553 flying to Washington DCA. He is very engaging with the passengers, understanding and funny 10/10 if we could copy and paste him I would for flights."
327,"✅ Trip Verified |  American airlines over booked my flight and offered me 300 to change. I called in to do so and they charged $246 instead. They just lost an executive platinum member. To add insult to injury when I called back to discuss why I was over charged after the airport could have done it for ""free"". I was told I was charged because I called. Stay far away from this company and their bad business practices."
328,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve flown to NZ several times. This was the first time with American Airlines. My mom and I were meeting my sister in Dallas to fly the rest of the way. Her first flight was delayed. She expressed concern she would miss our flight and they told her it would be fine. At the gate my mom and I explained she would be late due to a mechanical issue on their part and they didn’t even try to wait for her (as I have seen other airlines do in the past), instead they gave her seat to another passenger. While we were waiting to take off, still sitting at the gate she texted telling us they would not let her or six other passengers on. They only gave her a $12 meal ticket to last her 24 hours till her new flight. She was treated badly on our flight. We were given no warning that food was coming so the flight attendant rudely reached past my mom and slammed her folding table down without asking her if she even wanted anything. Then when they gave her the meal options and she was trying to decide the attendant gestured at her impatiently to ‘hurry up’ without giving her any time to think about it. Everyone we encountered was rude and insincere. The food was also terrible compared to other airlines. I will never fly with them again."
329,"✅ Trip Verified | After several delays for flight 2242 out of Greensboro to Dallas Fort Worth, I was happy when they called group #4 for Boarding. It was not until I was seated in row 13 that I realized I had left my white shawl, not just any shawl, but one I regularly wore during Communion and prayed with it on my shoulders. I frantically began swimming upstream against a flow of incoming passengers, none too happy. A friendly flight attendant looked my way. I quickly explained I needed to go get my shawl. She informed me that I’d have to take everything with me, meaning bag in overhead, purse. I must have looked hopeless, she said she was sorry. Then a voice from the cockpit said, where is it? The captain stepped out, I told him it was on a chair in front of the checkin counter. Captain Dave went to retrieve it. The attendant explained only the captain has that discretion. In less than a minute he handed me my beautiful white shawl. I hugged him and thanked him, yelling Hallelujah!!! There is still kindness is the world and given the chance you can find it. Thanks American Airlines for great team members like Captain Dave and the crew of flight 2242! Minister Vickee’ Armstrong headed to a Chaplain’s conference!"
330,"Not Verified | With 4 departure delays, you would expect the gate agent to at least be a neutral. After attempting to check in at the digital kiosk, we entered the line to check in. We were at the desk in a few minutes, it was not busy. We were practically barked at, ""Why aren't you at the kiosk?"" I had the phone bar code ready - no good for her. So, another bark requesting our names. My sister was part of our party, not on the same cc. She was equally rude to her, not wanting to process her ticket."
331,"Not Verified | My 21 year old daughter broke her foot while on a mission trip in Arlington, TX. We booked a flight to rush her home in an attempt to minimize the potential damage to the foot and get in to our doctor. She arrived at the airport in plenty of time, checked in and made it to the gate. The airline took her crutches and told her to wait. Then the airline changed the departure gate. By the time she made her way to the new gate (without airline assistance) they would not let her board the plane. The on-boarding time had passed. The plane was still at the gate. So, now she’s waiting for the next flight, hours later, with no crutches and no assistance."
332,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve had several negative experiences with airlines losing my checked baggage. I make it a point to travel light because of this, just a carry on nothing else. I was group 7 to board so by the time I got there there was no overhead bin space and I had to check my carry on luggage. To me that’s unacceptable, there should be one spot per seat and if someone else that boarded before me took my allotted space then that person should check his excess luggage not me. The attendant couldn’t care about my frustration, she was dismissive and rude. I won’t fly American Airlines again if possible. Too many times, I am done."
333,✅ Trip Verified |  They are the worst airline out there. It’s countless delays. They had us board a 8:35 pm plane then told us after we boarded that the plane was just towed over here for a maintenance issue. Turns out a hydraulic needed replacement and it would take an hour. This was at 9pm. So we’ve been delayed a hour and a half sitting in a plane like a sardine in a can with no airflow and stinky people. They don’t care. & have no accommodation for there passengers. They will never receive my money again.!
334,"Not Verified | A disaster from start to finish. The first flight, from Columbia to Charlotte was on an absolutely filthy plane. When we got to Charlotte, we were not able to get seat numbers assigned. The flight attendant told us to wait, so we did. I was informed I had to check my bag (which would have been fine had they not completely broken the outer shell to the point I can no longer use it) so i went to check it only to be informed i had to have my seat number first. By the time everyone else had boarded, we still had no tickets with seat numbers and ended up getting a receipt with the seat numers scribbled on the back, and we were the last people to board because of it. Very frustrated, mostly because of my suitcase. Attached photos show my bag literally right before I got on the plane and after."
335,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline ever, it was so dirty, staff was very rude. I will never fly with this airline again. A simple wipe of the window or the pull down tray is so simple. I had wipes but they were taken at security. Really made this flight grand. Just peachy. "
336,"Not Verified | This is the worst airline ever. I have flown 2 times in the last 6 months with them both having connecting flights and all were horrible! Family of 8 stuck on plane for 2 1/2 hours in PV no air conditioning for maintenance issue. Recent flight was diverted to Luckenbach because of fuel issue then sat for 3 hours there and pilots timed out! No water in bathroom to wash hands and toilet wouldn't flush! Finally got to Dallas and connector to Detroit canceled and was told nothing for 3 days! No food for everything was closed, all hotels full so had to sleep in chair at airport! Spirit Airlines has moved way above American airlines in my book!"
337,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines delayed AA2136 first due to weather / traffic control but later on the crew timed out and they couldn't find a replacement crew so they cancelled the flight. American Airlines did not compensate the passengers nor did they try to reinstate the flight after the weather issue passed. Other flights going to MCO took off 2 hours after they cancelled AA2136. American Airlines cancelled AA2136 after a 6-hour delay, I then requested for my checked in luggage to be returned to me via an agent in the Admiral Club so we can make alternate plans to save the spring break vacation. After waiting for 4 hours we were told American Airlines sent our luggage to MCO without us (AFTER they cancelled our flight). Since we were without our belongings it was impossible to make other plans so the entire spring break vacation was ruined. I have been an Executive Platinum member since 2019, this is definitely no way to treat any customers, let alone a loyal one."
338,"Not Verified |  Second time flying with American Airlines over the last month and they are just terrible. I don’t know what’s going on with their jets, but they may be due for an upgrade considering how they’re always needing maintenance that causes canceled flights or delays them by 4+ hours. The staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. Why are they even still in business at this point? Their jets are falling apart and outdated, poor customer service, horrible food/snacks. You would think I was flying with Spirit. No thank you. However, the terrible service from AA has made me appreciate Delta even more."
339,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had our flight booked from Charleston to Miami (non stop), 2 hours prior to departure the flight was canceled and we were automatically booked for another flight for the next day (1 stop) . We asked to be compensated for the cancellation in order to book a hotel and purchase dinner, the airline denied the request as they claimed the flight was cancelled due to “air traffic “. We spoke to other officials who assured us there was no such air traffic reported. American seems to be canceling flights to their convenience violating customer's rights, time & budget. We wont ever fly American again."
340,"✅ Trip Verified |  It is probably the worst of any American carrier! From terrible customer service to poor product to delays. Flight was delayed over five hours over first crew arrival, then maintenance and eventually paperwork for said maintenance! Finally arrived in MIA to no wheelchair assistance for over 40 mins for a first class customer! The wheelchair agent dropped me a line for assistance for hotel/rebooking as i misconnected and said he can’t stay with me or help me. Thankfully the passengers helped me only for AA to tell me no hotels are available but if i can find one they will reimburse. Now promptly i found many, i called one of them and they told they take airline hotel voucher from American and the agent from AA told me he can’t give a voucher because my flight leaves in few hours! Mind you at this point i had waited over 3 hours in a line and sat in a delayed plane in Colombia for 4 and half hours! Never again! I fly United and Delta and i was trying to not connect via BOG or PTY and thought on AA i could get home faster but no! Not only did i pay three times the fare for CTG to BNA for this day when compared to buying with United and Delta, I received terrible service only reinforcing why years ago i decided to go with Star Alliance and Delta as my back for intl travel!"
341,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines The worst travel experience ever! I have flown countless times all over the US and I have never had an encounter like the one from this week. Typically, you could have issues on one leg of the trip not both. Going to San Antonio, somehow our luggage ends up in Phoenix while we are in Texas. We came from a region where the temperature was 30 degrees and landed in full winter gear in a region that was 81 degrees with no luggage. “Go buy what you need and we will reimburse you for that and your luggage”. Okay…accidents happen, we can do that! However, on the way back  get to the airport to leave, “Your flight into Dallas is delayed causing you to miss your connecting flight into Omaha. The next flight is fully booked with no reasonable expectation that you can get standby. We can’t get you into Omaha for 2 days”. “Okay so you are going to put us in a hotel or reimburse us, correct?” “No! It’s weather related.” On radar the “storm” was the day before, has long since cleared the area, and nothing current or on the horizon. We have kids, animals, and other responsibilities at home that we must be back today but you expect us to sleep on the airport floor for 2 days.  We are left to figure out our own way home after we get checked in to Dallas. Flight out of San Antonio gets delayed 3x and there are no rental cars within 25 miles of the Dallas airport and none open that do have vehicles. We find seats open on a flight to Kansas City which the employee originally said was full, go get booked onto that flight. Closest we could get to Omaha but still have to rent a car and drive home. Get to Dallas and our flight to KC gets delayed. Finally get to KC at 11:30 PM! Go to get our luggage but it never made it on the plane!! 3+ hour layover and y’all couldn’t even get that right. So there we were 2 1/2 & 4 hours away from home just to have to figure out yet again how we will get our belongings after everything else that we had to go through! We finally get the rental car after dealing with baggage issues for about an hour after our flight landed. Then we have to make the long drive home! We get home but it was strictly through our own perseverance not due to good customer service on behalf of your airline! Unbeknownst to you, I sat in the very last row by the flight attendants and could hear every single word of the conversation about how a “technical computer issue” was compounded by a weather event and instead of doing right by your passengers, your company decided to log the entire multi day situation under a “weather event” so that you did not have to make financial reimbursements or find accommodations for the passengers effected! You used the weather related incidents loophole in the US DOT “commitments to controlled delays” section to avoid a financial impact to your company, thus passing the cost to your customers in lieu of being accountable for an already existing technical issue your airline had! And….. I still don’t have my belongings. "
342,"Not Verified |  The horrible incompetence of this airline, which left Dallas hours late to Houston to pick us up in Houston, meant that connecting flights were missed, ruining the first half of my spring vacation. I will never book with American again, because they put you on these regional airlines without your knowledge, and these regional airlines are notoriously poor. The couple waiting next to me missed their flight to LA so that they couldn’t get their flight to Bali."
343,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delays. Took me 11 hours. I decided to fly American after not doing so for years because I wanted a nicer flight. Dumb idea. Late, delays but most importantly arrogant personnel. Flat affect. No customer service. Never again. You have lost my business forever!"
344,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely appalled and infuriated by our horrendous ordeal with American Airlines. Our management team has been stranded in Charlotte, NC, for over a grueling 10 hours, following what was supposed to be a brief stopover from Grand Rapids. The behavior of American Airlines staff in Grand Rapids was deplorable, obnoxious, and utterly dismissive. They seemed to find it completely acceptable to extend a mere 45-minute layover to an interminable 10-hour wait, without so much as a blink of an eye. Their attitude was appalling. Upon our weary arrival in Charlotte, a glimmer of hope was provided by a lounge representative who revealed that, contrary to what we were told in Grand Rapids, we could have been booked on earlier flights home. Seats were available, yet we were misled to believe otherwise. During the endless hours spent in Charlotte, conversations with various airport employees, restaurant workers, and shop attendants painted a stark picture of American Airlines’ reputation—delayed flights and a glaring disregard for customer service seem to be the norm, leading many to question how they remain in operation. It’s downright disgraceful. We are resolved to never fly with American Airlines again and strongly advise others to steer clear of them. Their indifference to our situation caused us to miss crucial meetings, showing a blatant lack of concern for their passengers’ time and commitments. A truly disgusting experience."
345,"Not Verified |  Having been based in Miami, FL I've had no choice but to fly AA for the past 20 years. I hace accumulated miles and have status. But I've observed that the overall experience flying American Airlines has declined. At first it seems small, but reflecting on all the small changes that have added up, it's big. The customer service on the ground is average at best, and if there's a delayed flight or aircraft issues, oh boy. Rude and dismissive. But the flight experience itself has gotten so much worse. The seat pitch has been reduced to a point of ridiculousness. They charge premium options for extra space on terrible seats. Bulkheads often have different cushions that are hard and super uncomfortable. I also had a chance to fly some other airlines recently. None of them are great, but the experience was significantly better."
346,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines lost my wheelchair and didn't take responsibilities. And nobody even apologized. All I asked was that my wheelchair was to be ready at the door when I arrived. Nobody even thought to double check and when there was clearly a problem, instead of coming forth with it and apologizing they made me wait for so long even though I had connecting flight. And then blamed others for the problem saying ""I was in an airplane so I couldn't have known."" They really wanted to get me off their sight, and passed me away to airport workers. The manager did come but he didn't say anything.  Had airport workers not found my wheelchair, my whole trip was entirely ruined, like how was I supposed to enjoy the trip without means to walk? "
347,Not Verified |   I was on flight AA708 last night that was scheduled to depart at 9:15. Maintenance issues as we were sitting on the plane at the gate forever. Finally sent to another gate in the netherlands (Miami is a huge airport). We arrived in DCA after 3 am. This flight was made even more miserable because of the attitude of the flight attendants. In first class we were not even offered a cup of water or a biscotti though I asked for one. We hadn't had anything since the last flight at 6. I did get to watch the flight attendants eat a bag of chips in their jump seats as they were right in front of me. Claimed it was too bumpy to serve. We were an arms length away from them. What has happened to service and a nice friendly demeanor?
348,"✅ Trip Verified |  Started out in Knoxville airport where something was wrong with the plane, but instead of telling us what was going on, the agent called up a few people at a time to rebook even though I was in line first because I knew something was wrong. Then, finally when the agent, who was extremely obnoxious with her stupid happy smirk, overly positive typing skills and repeatedly saying “Spring has Spruuung”, gave me a ticket to Charlotte where I’d be on standby for my next flight. (Pretty much just to get me outa her hair). In Charlotte, I ended up going to the help desk where an agent got me a legit ticket in like one minute. It was the same flight where the agent had put me on standby after typing for twenty minutes. Then the 4 people on standby who all showed up at the last minute ended up with seats in aisles 8 & 9 while I’m back in last aisle. I can’t stand this airline. I wish the company cared about its reviews, its customers, peoples comfort, and kept up with maintenance on their planes but all they care about is money. You really should just be shut down."
349,"Not Verified |  Our flight got delayed several hours because of maintenance issues. They made everyone board and then unboard which took hours in itself and they were terrible to us during that time. I realize the flight attendants were getting frustrated but the eye rolling and attitude wasn’t needed. We were ready to put that all behind us but then we get on the flight (finally) and our tray table is broken (fine we can deal with that) the wifi doesn’t work for a good while and the flight attendants are once again giving us attitude. I don’t know what it is with this airline and its flight attendants but they’re some of the meanest, most entitled people you will ever meet. I literally just asked what drinks they have when they were coming around because I didn’t know and no one told me they had a menu, I get “what? You want me to sit here and list off all the drinks for you?”. Like excuse me? Did I ask for your attitude? I respond with “well I don’t know what drinks you have but you can just show me as well” and to be honest I don’t even think she was listening to me because she goes off about how they have a menu and I need to stop being lazy. Real great way to start a flight that is causing us to spend ANOTHER night away from home. We can’t even go home tonight because of the delay we have to stay in a hotel room in some random city that they’re dropping us off in. No consideration for the day we just had and their customer service is atrocious. If it was a one off I wouldn’t even mind as much but it’s been non stop attitude from these flight attendants when we’re the ones getting screwed over. Best part, they had just finished saying over the intercom that the flight attendants were here because they wanted to help us. lol. Yeah never flying with American Airlines again and I hope they fire the girl that can’t even tell us there’s a menu nicely. Do better American Airlines. Your hospitality is absolutely atrocious"
350,"Not Verified |   Our flight from PHX to Kona Hawaii was over 7 hours due to head winds (FLT 603 ON 17 FEB 24 arrival Kona at approximately 4:00pm). Normally a 6+ hour flight with no food service or even food for sale for premium economy or economy seating. I was able to buy a 1/2 size can of Pringles for $5.00. Was told they originally had a ""few cheese plates but they quickly sold out"". They had one full drink service within a hour of departing PHX, with only a glass of water (no ice) offered approximately 1 hour before landing in Kona."
351,"✅ Trip Verified |  They overcharge me $50, they charge me $50 to ensure that my baggage could go on the flight. I have medication in there that I need in case I have a medical issue, I paid the $50 when I got to the gate they refused to allow me to bring my small small bag onto the airline and made me check it because they said the cabin was full. But I had already paid for the space, when I tried to work with them to get the $50 back they essentially said sorry. I had booked through a travel agency cheapo air, they told me that the $50 was the airline fee in the airline had to give it back to me. But I have documentation the airline telling me it’s not their problem. It’s the travel agency problem. I don’t care whose problem it is they overcharge me $50 and did not give me the services and they should honor their airline and give me that money back. They are very lucky that I did not have a medical episode while I was on the flight. Do not buy into any of the extra booking fees because it’s all a lie and you will not get your money back."
352,Not Verified | I'm on a business trip. Flight got delayed and manager onsite is not helping other than rebooked our flights. No common courtesy to help us a place to rest and the next flight is 6hrs later. I've never experienced this but this AA airline is poor. Will never fly with them again
353,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently flew round trip from Toronto to New Zealand and the flight attendants were awful. They barely welcomed us on board. I have a broken collar bone and could not find any FA in sight. I had a sling on and explained my medical condition when I finally found one. I asked for assistance putting my bag in the overhead, I was told on 3 flights they were too busy. On the 4th flight the FA told me if I couldn't lift it, she couldn't either. Luckily there were very kind passengers around who heard this and helped me on each flight. I sent an email to American, their response was ""sorry you had an inconvenience on our flight, we look forward to welcoming you on board soon""."
354,"Not Verified |  I will never give American Airlines my business again. Not only did our flight board late, with no acknowledgement that this was taking place, but it left 1.5 hours late from Jamaica. Therefore, us (with many many other passengers) missed our connecting flights (which were the last flights of the day) causing us to be stranded until the next day. The worst part was the horrible customer service. The customer service reps had a chip on their shoulders the minute they were approached at the desk. They argued with the customer’s for hours about the fact that the missed flights were due to the airline’s delays. After several hours, they finally acknowledged the airline’s fault of the missed flights. By that time, most passengers gave up on trying to get a hotel room and transportation due to the terrible attitudes of the representatives. To top this horrible experience off, they mocked the fact that we had no luggage for the night and would go without very important medications for 12+ hours. Stuff happens but the horrible customer service is very unnecessary and I will not give 1 more penny of my hard earned money to such a terrible company."
355,"Not Verified |  I had just finished a months long trip via Jet Blue, JAL and Vietnam Airlines and American was my last leg and the company I booked the airfare with. Besides being 4 hours delayed at DFW, the crew was terrible as was any adherence to any FAA rules. On the active taxi way, customers were up and going to the bathroom without a word from the crew, window shades were down when the announcement said they have to be up for takeoff. And the food - the plane was delayed from a 9:45 takeoff to 1200 and we didn’t depart until 12:15. And the meal in 1st class - still breakfast from the 9:45 flight - mystery omelette. Even boarding, we stood in the bridge for 10 minutes (freezing cold). What a terrible experience. Especially after being on JAL for 4 flights - how an airline is supposed to treat customers. I will do everything I can to avoid ever getting on your airline again"
356,"✅ Trip Verified |  As usual very nice flight. Check in in Miami fast and easy and friendly. Boarding quick and well organized. Flight attendants were very friendly, helpful and cheerful. Flight left a bit delayed as an on board computer needed a reset done by maintenance. Nevertheless we landed on time. Always a pleasure flying AA in Business Class on that route. I dare to say that all the passengers in business class - which only seats 8 looked content."
357,"✅ Trip Verified |  I rarely feel the urge to write a review, however, as a family of 4 travelling from the UK to Belize via the US over Christmas, I felt I had to inform others of the exceptionally poor service American Airlines provides. In total we had 4 flights with the airline, my main gripe refers to our flight from Miami to Belize which should have only been a 90 minute flight but was delayed for 9 hours. Firstly the previous crew had highlighted an electrical issue with our plane but we boarded relatively on time, only to taxi to the runway, do an about turn back to the stand as the fault had reoccurred. After sitting on the tarmac for about 40 minutes we were sent back to the terminal to await further news. The issue couldn't be fixed quickly so we awaited a replacement plane, which we subsequently found out had un resolved maintenance issues, time passed and we awaited a 3rd plane - again with issues, but which they could fix in a reasonable time. Several hours had passed at this point. The Pilot's working hours had then expired to we had to wait for another pilot, again 2 attempts to find a pilot, then the first officer's hours expired, again await another first officer. 9hrs later we finally left Miami, missed a day of our holiday, had to pay extra transport costs due to the very late arrival of the plane. The end result being a paltry $50 credit with the airline that I will never be flying with again. On the outbound UK flight some of the crew were rude - having been asked if headphones came in child sizes by another passenger I overhead a crew member walk away sniggering saying who does he think we are Target! They ran out of meat meals and thrust veggie options at us, with a 'tough this is all we have left' attitude. On the inbound flight having had to wait 20 minutes for wine with my meal that had long been eaten I was virtually thrown a bottle - with no glass to drink it with. We are seasoned travellers and I've never experienced such appalling service and from a well established airline I certainly didn't expect it. Needless to say I won't ever be flying with them again. It has also put me off travelling via the US in future."
358,"Not Verified |  Don't bother to reach out to customer service if you would like an issue resolved. They will continue to send you generalized responses about nothing being able to be done, while telling you how much they ""value you as a customer"" and hope you will return in the future. Consistently changing flights and overbooking in an effort to please shareholders over customers. As someone who books travel for upper level management and our board of directors I will, without a doubt, be securing flights through another carrier for all future meetings/trips. Booking in advance is often required if you would like a reasonable price on flights and would like to secure your desired time in addition to knowing you can book rental cars and hotel stay. I check all three of these prior to booking so I can be sure all are available and I am receiving the best deal possible. Some folks are very particular about nonstop flights. I recently planned a trip around a nonstop flight. Both my outbound and inbound flights were changed to add stops. A refund was offered; however, I had already made travel plans to go along with my flight dates and times weeks prior. Additionally, there were no other non-stop flights on my date. When inquiring about the cause to the change, AA told me they were ""unable to give specifics"" translating to  it's on us, but we do not take accountability. As someone diagnosed and medicated for anxiety, not having to make a stop and traverse an airport (especially a larger airport like DFW) in a 40 minute window is important to me, as is consistency. This, again, remains extremely disappointing, I am not pleased with the overall customer service and do not feel any resolution was reached."
359,"✅ Trip Verified |  I experienced significant challenges with American Airlines following the cancellation of our flight from College Station to Buenos Aires on December 30, 2023. This cancellation prevented my wife and me from joining our family for a highly anticipated New Year's Eve reunion, causing not only emotional distress but also financial losses due to non-refundable accommodations. In seeking compensation, our first response from American Airlines was the offer of a mere 2,500 bonus miles, a gesture that felt dismissively inadequate given the scale of our inconvenience and loss. Upon expressing our dissatisfaction and outlining the extent of our losses, including the missed family event and its emotional significance, American Airlines then proposed a marginally improved but still insufficient compensation of 17,500 miles. Our continued correspondence highlighted the disparity between our actual losses and the compensation offered, emphasizing that the financial and emotional impacts far exceeded what was being acknowledged. Despite our appeals for a fair and balanced compensation reflective of the full extent of our inconvenience and financial losses, the final counter offer received was a $300 credit. This amount represents only a fraction of the cost of the tickets. Accepting this credit did not equate to satisfaction with the resolution. It merely shows the extent to which American Airlines falls short of providing adequate care and compensation. Given this experience, we have resolved never to fly with this airline again unless faced with a life-or-death situation and no other carrier options are available."
360,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have top tier Alaska status and have started flying American more because of the new One World partnership. Miserable employees and terrible customer service have been a consistent theme with American on almost all of our trips, but this trip was likely our last straw. We were delayed an hour and 20 minutes due to a mechanical issue coming out of New Orleans. Our layover was only 45 minutes in DFW, so unfortunately this moderate delay meant we’d miss our connection. No problem, this was an afternoon flight, there are 2 more flights from DFW to SFO. American oversells their flights out of DFW and bumps so many passengers that all flights to SFO were fully booked until 6 PM the following day, or just under 24 hours after we were supposed to land. Keep in mind that’s like 6 flights that are booked out. We’re ok to go to San Jose or Oakland to try to get home same day. Nope, nothing there either. I see options to divert on united, delta, and JetBlue to get home before 1 AM and not miss another day of work. Their contract only covers united and delta diversions and they don’t see these options in their system. Ok, can the customer service team escalate? No… if it’s not on their computer screen, there’s nothing they can do. And I have top tier one world status, would hate to not have status. I’ve had this situation happen before, American somehow took possession of a British airways reservation during a check in screw up by their agent last year which meant BA could not physically check me into the flight that I was supposed to be on. the phone agent in the UK for American successfully diverted me to a virgin flight to help rectify the mistake that would have kept me in London several extra days due to flight schedules and availability. Crisis averted, the agent went above and beyond and fixed the mistake. These American agents stateside would not hear of such a thing, they don’t call other airlines. I ask to speak to a supervisor. They take around 15 minutes and then get back on the phone and just tell me “this is so and so, she will explain how things work to you.” Probably the worst phrase you could say to a frustrated customer and a basic customer service mistake. Basically, “I’m not going to listen to you, you listen to me.” Awesome. So now I’m on with the supervisor, and she repeats his lines. Not willing to call. If it’s not on her screen it doesn’t exist to American despite flight availability online. And he was their chief advisor so if her employee couldn’t figure it out, no one could. I fear for those that get the non customer advisor customer service people. She isn’t able to help, I’ll deal with it at the airport. At the airport, our checkin person was probably new as she had to ask for help a number of times, but we had a weird situation and she did her best. She was very polite. We accept that we need to fly out the next morning and they’ll put us up at a hotel in Dallas during our layover. We land at 7:20 and are out at an airport holiday inn, which is fine. They have a shuttle, great. We call for the shuttle, it’s going to be 15 to 20 minutes. Not Americans fault on this part, but we were picked up an hour later and then drive around the airport for another hour before heading to the hotel. Not joking. We check in at 10:30. Just insult to injury at this point. We eat some cold delivery dinner and try to get some Zs. Never again American. Well pay extra to fly with anyone else."
361,"Not Verified |   Flight delayed in Flagstaff to Phoenix, decided to drive 2 hrs to Phoenix to catch my connected fight to Portland thinking I would get a refund for unused flight. American Airlines told me to pound sand not their problem. I will never fly American again, I will pay more for another airline next time."
362,"✅ Trip Verified | I used to hold American Airlines in high regard. No more. They have slipped severely the past few years on service. I traveled from Lake Charles to DFW for my connecting flight to Chicago O'Hare to see my daughter and grandson for the first time in 4 years. I bought a first class ticket and wheel chair assistance because I am disabled. DFW had flights backed up coming into the airport. They claimed it was weather related. Wasn't even raining when I arrived. My assistant for my wheelchair tried his best to get me to my connecting flight on time. We had 20 minutes to get 30 minutes across the terminals to my gate. Plane left without me. No flights available until the next morning. I had to rebook. I expected a hotel and meal voucher. They were handing them out like candy for other flights. But because they claimed it was weather, management refused to give me a voucher. You would think they would should some accommodation because I bought an expensive first class ticket. Not to mention, I brought up ADA laws and reasonably accommodation for disability. Both staff were nasty rude people and have no business in management. Yes, I lost my temper and called them both a name after they pushed me to my limits. So here I am right now trying to sleep in a chair at my gate at the airport for my flight that's eight hours from now without any dinner or accomodations. I should be in Chicago right now, but American Airlines left me stranded at DFW and refused to make it right. The first time I buy a first class ticket and I am treated like trash."
363,"✅ Trip Verified |  American airlines has the worst customer service. Before boarding They say they allow only 1 cabin bag, and despite having empty cabin space in the flight they force you to check in your cabin baggage at the gate.  They threaten you to not board and take another flights and pay fare difference. They don’t monitor people and those who get in early with more than one allowed carry on and they force people who get in later to check in the carryon without even verifying properly if there is cabin space or not. "
364,"✅ Trip Verified | Unreliable, never runs on time, they don’t reimburse for lost time or money. Customer service is inept and full of excuses. This airline is getting worse every time, they don’t value their customers"
365,"Not Verified |  Terrible experience. I was scheduled to leave from gate A-23 they changed it at the last minute, I got to the gate when the door to the tarmac was still opened, when I get there one of the gal's slams the door tells me rudely you are not getting on (already checked in on line seat assigned). I told her my seat was already paid for and assigned, then she gets more rude and obnoxious very unprofessional, I ask for her name and she proceeds to be rude and walks away had to go to customer service for there names. Will not be flying with American again. I'd rather pay a little bit more."
366,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight from MIA to EZE was delayed 11+ hours because American did not have a crew available. No weather, or other issues, just stupidity on their part. I requested reimbursement because I missed an entire day of my vacation (was supposed to land at 10a, instead arrive at 9p), and their offer of ""12,500 airline miles"" is what they deemed as ""reasonable."" I spent $2600 on the flight with them (don't even get me started on the number of times I had to call and rebook my flight because they kept automatically re-booking me), $2700 on the vacation, $650 on domestic flights, plus additional expenses, in addition to the year of saving for the trip and taking time off work. In order to get anything more, they want me to submit ""itemized receipts"" for them to review and they will ""consider"" reimbursing me. I lost out on a whole lot more than just ""12,500"" airline miles can make up for. Their customer service, was horrible to work with. Only providing stock answers-- their mind was made up before she even talked to me so I had no hope of getting any kind of reasonable settlement.  I will never fly AA again. "
367,"Not Verified |  Very disappointed in drinks given out. Warm, half of glass of water. We paid good money and AA can't afford ice. Never again book this company. Very warm in plane and could not hear messages on intercom. Really need to update speakers."
368,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying this route quite frequently and what seems to be apparent: the food offering has improved markedly to 2023. As usual with AA: check in at Toronto was easy, pleasant, stress free. Boarding fast and efficient. Flight crew as expected from prior flights just phenomenal. All in all the flight on February 2nd AA1572 was perfect."
369,"Not Verified |  I had 2 layovers, one of which required me to sleep in an airport. Fine, I booked that, not complaining about that. But my second layover was a flight from Phoenix to Dallas, then Dallas to Oaxaca. They gave me 30 minutes to deplane In Dallas and get to my flight to Oaxaca, which required taking a train to a different terminal. When I asked them the night before at the kiosk during my previous overnight layover if I could get on an earlier to Dallas, they said no. The only reason I made my connecting flight is because we landed 15 minutes early. When booking my flight, I had no option but this layover. Also despite this, the crew didn’t even let people who had short layovers leave first, and there were at least 3 other people sitting around me who had one hour or less like me. My flight was literally boarding as we landed. As a result some other passenger actually blockaded me in and yelled at me because I was trying to deplane before him. None of that would’ve happened if AA had been more proactive or had any sort of forethought about the situation. Actual flight itself was fine, staff is friendly, but truly this layover experience and getting abused by another passenger as a result of it is going to make me avoid AA at all costs. "
370,"Not Verified |  I have never been so disappointed with an airline service as I have been with American Airlines. This is one airline that I never wish to travel on but unfortunately the only flight available for us was AA. There has never been a time when they haven’t delayed their flights for hours. Last time we flew AA we kept getting delayed and rerouted. All the delays and extended layovers has always ruined our trip one way or the other. Our flights are delayed again today for 2 hrs and we we won’t be home until past midnight. We have to get home to our 11 month old daughter who isn’t feeling well and nothing can be done. AA doesn’t even have the decency to apologize properly to Theo customers for doing this every single time. This is extremely frustrating! We simply dont want to fly with AA again, and no giving us a flight credit will simply not solve the issue because we do not want to fly AA again."
371,"✅ Trip Verified |  My trip with American Airlines had multiple issues that occurred throughout the day and they were not all weather related as the airline tried to blame it on. I do know that many other planes landed and took off while our plane circle the airport on Flight Aware, before being re-routed to another airport. due to this, the next flight I was placed on was delayed due to an inoperable jetway and then another delay due to the push vehicle not functioning, which had to be disconnected from the plane and have a new one brought in. Then, once finally in Chicago, flight 6030, the plane I was told by one of the AA representatives in Houston that I would be in the first (Priority) standby position, was delayed due to a maintenance issue. This plane was delayed due to a switch on the plane that was malfunctioning. Eventually, it was determined that the repair could not be made and so that flight was switched to another plane at another gate. Once at the new gate, I am told I am in the second standby position and not the first as I was told I would be. As I now mentioned to the attendant at the new gate, I only had limited time to get to the bus terminal to catch the last bus of the night back to Milwaukee, my final destination, if I was not seated on this flight. They advised me I would get a seat and that I should wait until boarding was completed. I was not given a seat on this plane which led to me missing the last bus of the night to Milwaukee. I then went back to an AA representative to find out when was the next flight I could be put on to Milwaukee. I was informed it would be around 1:00 PM on the following day. Of course the expectation (as told to me by AA personnel) was for me to spend the night in the airport waiting for this plane. At this point, I chose to hire an Uber ride back to Milwaukee at a cost of $108.00 plus a tip. So, there were far more things that went on besides a simple weather delay. I was looking for compensation for mechanical breakdowns, my aggravation at being misled by AA personnel and the cost of my Uber ride. AA then offered me a $25.00 voucher for use on my next flight with them, along with an explanation that this was all their policies would allow for. I typically fly Southwest Airlines and have never experienced such poor customer relations as I did in this instance with American Airlines. From rude gate attendants to all the above mentioned issues and a policy that clearly shows a lack of customer relations, I will never consider using American again."
372,"Not Verified | I purchased four round-trip tickets to Asia, for our family. The trip was set for December 15th, 2023, at 6:57 am, we were to depart from Raleigh RDU airport to Dallas, Dallas to Tokyo, and Tokyo to our final destination in Taipei, Taiwan. On the evening of December 14th, 2023, I attempted to check in all of my family online around 3-4 pm that afternoon, but the American Airlines online check-in was down, so we were forced to check in in person. On December 15th, 2023, our family stood in line for check-in, for about 3 hours, we finally arrived at the American Airlines ticket counter at 5:30 am (According to American Airlines' agent's time stamp).  We know that there were over 300 people in lines trying to check in because American Airlines check-in kiosks were down, and all domestic and international flight passengers, and baggage drop-off, were forced to check in person,  What made things worse was that two of the four American Airlines agents were assisting customers who were taking up more than 20—30 minutes each, at a time, and this left only 2 available agents to check in the all the passengers. According to Sarah Gianni, a Customer Relations from American Airlines, our family arrived at their check-in counter at 5:30 am, and upon showing our ticket reservation, the American Airlines ticket agent started to accuse us of being “late”, accused us of being late to the counter, she said there was no way we could make it to the flight and she refused to check us in.  I told her our flight leaves at 6:57 am, and we still can make it.  We asked the agent to double-check, to see if we were indeed going to miss our flight, and the American Airlines ticket agent refused to check and just replied ""No way"".  She scolded us that we should know better than to be there at least 5 hours ahead, during the holidays, to check in early. The agent seemed to be overwhelmed and very rude to us told us to go away, and refused to help us in any way. I have been in touch with our booking site Justfly.com, who also refused to help and told us that because American Airlines said we were late, therefore, we were to forfeit our entire tickets. I pleaded with the agent to help and instead of trying to help us resolve this, they said we were considered a no-show, therefore all of the tickets were canceled, including the return flights on 12/27/2023, and we didn't even get on any of the flights. After weeks of dealing with American Airlines customer service, trying to get them to help us recoup our loss, they are now telling us to contact Japan Airlines, told us that our tickets were not in their stock. Japan Airlines told us that American Airlines was responsible, and they couldn't help us, Justfly.com was just a nightmare to deal with from the beginning, first, they refused to help, and then they tried to gauge us for an additional $5600, they said if we paid, then we will get a new one-way ticket and our return flight can be reactivated. All this originated from American Airlines's chaos. Their disorganization cost my family out of $10K for our flights. Don't buy tickets from Justfly.com, and stay away from deals with American Airlines, it is just chaos altogether. Never again."
373,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced! A flight attendant took my carry-on bag in the plane cause there was no more space and never gave me a bag tag. When I got to the baggage claim my bag was not there and I don’t have it to this day. It’s been over a month now and the customer service process (which is still ongoing) has been a true nightmare. I have to call continuously to get a follow up. The person in charge of my file is completely unresponsive and there’s no one I can reach out to, to address this issue. No matter how cheap the tickets are, I will never in my life book a ticket with American Airlines and don’t recommend the airline to anybody!"
374,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight was changed due to a scheduling error where AA book a flight where we would miss our connection. Instead of fixing it, they change the destination completely to Raleigh Durham. Our plan was to drive from Fayetteville to Myrtle Beach with family. When asked since they changed the destination could we just get a final destination to Myrtle Beach instead, they claimed those flights were sold out and no available Fayetteville flights were left. So we have to take the destination change to a city completely out of the way and on top of that, it’s currently scheduled to be delayed as well. Also, flights to regional airports are more expensive than flights to international. No offer to reimburse, no offer to upgrade seats, no offer to waive checked bag fees, just “we’re sorry about that, that’s best we can do.”"
375,"Not Verified | Absolutely under no circumstances should you use American Airlines. At this point I'd rather risk it with a door flying off with United. I had multiple trips cancel, had to drive half of the way before getting another flight. The refund they processed doesn't even cover the price difference for the rescheduled flight and the travel credit was even more insulting for $25. Every time I call I’m told they don't handle complaints over the phone, only email. So I email and get zero response. Do yourself a favor and book with ANYONE ELSE!"
376,"Not Verified |  Do not book a flight with American Airlines if your ability to fly is in question! My intended flight starts tomorrow but I can't go. American Airlines bumped me from the flight I originally picked to a different one, that would leave me in a waiting area of LAX overnight with the last leg of this flight landing after 10 p.m.  My only options are to reschedule or cancel the flight & get a refund. Alaskan Airlines does everything possible to prevent a ticket holder from doing either one. I tried using the website but it directed me to call the customer service number instead. That number has an answering system that ""due to the abnormally high number of callers"" (a standard excuse) will put you on hold forever.  The last time I tried using it, I waited two & a half hours & never heard a real human voice. The situation is obvious: once AA gets your money & sells you flight tickets, it does not care what happens. You will probably get bumped to a worse flight than the one you bought. If you can't make it, the company will do whatever it takes to not refund your money. The stress of dealing with AA's obstinacy triggered my two other conditions; now I really can't do the trip."
377,"Not Verified | Arrived in Dallas, our plane was supposed to leave for Kansas city at 833pm, I'm not sure about the time we boarded the plane but it was very late, once the plane was boarded with all the seats full, we sat there for over 30 minutes, then the pilot came on the intercom & advised our plane would not embark on Kansas city as the flight crew was at the end of their 12 hour period. So we unloaded & went back into the terminal, we were advised that American Airlines would send us an email with a voucher for transportation & a room for the night. We never received this voucher, we did get a $12 food voucher for use in the airport, the only place open was a seven11 which the voucher wasn't not good for there, so we had to wait until morning to use it. I am a 77 year old veteran who had to try & sleep on a hard bench in the airport, it was very cold, not a good way to treat a customer. We were advised the night before that our flight would be leaving at 7am the next morning from the same gate. However, after seeing the gate wasn't being opened at 7am like it should have been, we went to find another American airlines gate that was opened, they advised us that our flight would be leaving from a different gate number, since it was suppose to leave shortly we had to catch a tram to get to our gate, our flight was delayed again, it was over an hour before our plane left for Kansas city. American Airlines needs to refund all moneys we paid for their poor service."
378,Not Verified | I missed my outgoing flight and they cancelled my return flight with no warning and no refund. Customer service associated couldn't possibly have cared less. I am a card member but I will be cancelling my card (it was impossible to use the miles anyway) and taking my business elsewhere. Company of scam artists.
379,"✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines customer service is absolute trash. I flew home Monday from Chicago, finally, after 6 delays and 9 hours worth of waiting. The delays were not weather related. I finally made it home after 1 am from a flight that was supposed to arrive at 4:15pm, only to find my luggage was still in Chicago. I filed a claim and was told it is typically 24 hours for bags to be returned. It is now day 4 and my bag has not even moved from where it has been since Monday (I have an AirTag). The customer service has been a joke. Every person has different answer and none have any above them I can speak to. The last person was incredibly rude to my wife and told her “She must have a misconception of what their baggage claim department does.” They are all so beyond useless, I don’t even know why they employ people there. The only people seemingly willing to help is the ones we reached out to on social media. It is now the 4th day of not having my luggage. I have paid $700 out of pocket to replace a medical device that is in my luggage. I spend a ton of money with this airline traveling for my sons hockey, and I can’t believe the customer service has been this poor. I am currently looking into taking my business elsewhere because of this entire experience."
380,"Not Verified |  American Airlines is by far the worst experience (now the third time for us). Last night was the SECOND time we have been delayed at Charlotte airport with American Airlines because of not having an available crew to even fly the plane. Third time they have lost our luggage and by the far the worst customer service we have ever experienced in our lives. Literally. I have tried to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge in luggage and I was told “we don’t have anyone in charge of us”, twice. But yet another department claimed they do have supervisors to speak to. I have reached out to customer relations via online and only getting general letters back thanking us for feedback and can’t wait for us to fly with them again (if they were really reading my communication with them they would know this is by far accurate). I was told I could send a physical letter via mail because it’s impossible to speak to someone in customer relations. But this invisible help is supposed to be who helps their customers during a crisis?! Please share and get the word out! This is absolutely ridiculous. "
381,"✅ Trip Verified | 15+ hours total for a maybe 3 hour flight! Tried taking with airline employees and 90% of them were just rude. My luggage was lost for hours and no airline employees were willing to help locate them, they just wanted me to file a claim. I contacted customer service to see what we could do about it and they offered me 2,500 extra reward miles!! No 2,500 fly miles will not suffice for the experience that I had to deal with. I do not plan on flying American anymore... I tried speaking with someone else through customer support and was told that she's all I get. Get right American, I'd rather fly Spirit."
382,"✅ Trip Verified |  Come on American! Get your act together. After numerous delays for weather, we waited on the plane for an hour prior to take off while waiting for a mechanic to bring a log to the pilot. Unacceptable given everyone had already waited through delays."
383,"✅ Trip Verified | First, the lady at the counter treated my wife like a criminal. She was trying to check an empty bag so she could bring clothes from Idaho back to Greenville. The lady grabs a tape measure and says, this bag is a couple inches too long. You will have to pay $200, or you can throw it away. She ended up throwing the bag away because it is less than $200 to replace it. Then, when the airline sends a notification that inclement weather could impact our trip, she moved the flight later by 2 days. She was charged $61 to downgrade to Main Cabin! When I spoke to customer service, they said ""If you called us, we would have kept you First Class, but since you changed it yourself, we aren't going to honor your original Ticket. I travel for business every week, and will make sure none of that travel is with American in the future. I would recommend avoiding this airline if you can. They treat customers like trash."
384,✅ Trip Verified | Easy check in. Easy and fast and civilized boarding. Very pleasant and accommodating inflight crew. Just a pleasant and stress free experience. We always choose AA on this route and have never been disappointed. On a side note: Looks to me that compared to 2023 the food presented in business class on this route has improved markedly.
385,"✅ Trip Verified |  We departed PUJ approx 1/2 hour late. This reduced our connecting flight (to Dallas) time from 1 hr and 22 mins to 52 mins approx. We had to go through immigration and check our bag back and then go through security. We ended up missing the next flight to Dallas. AA staff was not helping expedite the process and then they did not give us booking into the next flight. They put us on stand by at 5 AM with no guarantee of catching that flight. They also issued two stand by tickets in my daughters name and none in my name. I caught this error after they closed the counter for the night. During this time they discouraged us from getting a hotel and sleep downstairs at the airport among the homeless people taking refuge there. Ater insisting, they told that they would give a voucher for Courtyard Marriott. But gave a voucher for Wyndham. I caught this later too. Wyndham shuttle driver did not show until 12 pm. I declined the hotel because we needed to be back at the airport by 3 AM to correct my ticket and in my naiive mind increase my chances of getting seating in the 5am flight to Dallas so that I can make the connection to San Jose California. My kids had to sleep on the seats downstairs outside of the security gates. I stayed up the whole time to secure our bags and the family. After AA counter opened, we corrected the tickets at the counter and entered the airport through security. We did not get seats in the 5AM flight. From that point on we were treated badly, dismissed, and blamed for the close timing of the connecting flights when we had no option to choose the flight route. Therefore, blaming us for missing the flight or blaming immigration for making us late. It was AA that booked the whole route for our flight. After getting the run around and getting upset. Two ladies at customer service at our insistence booked us to LA via Las Vegas because we just wanted to get out of this God forsaken airport. We got to Vegas Airport to ask for help from a supervisor at AA. She was kind enough to get us on United airlines to San Jose and told CV us that the people at Charlotte should have booked us on another airline if there was no other option and all the way to San Jose California. We were marginalized, blamed and treated inhumanely by AA across the board. The AA staff was displaying a major trip with upset passengers. One family had a toddler who was crying for 1 hour and the AA staff was numb to this family's needs. The worst flight experience in my life. Even third world countries showed more respect and value for the elderly and families with children."
386,"Not Verified |  Had a layover in Miami that was scheduled to leave @8:40pm. Was informed around 9pm that they were having staffing issues. @9:30pm we were informed that they have staff on the way and they should arrive in 20 minutes from Chicago - as they had some weather issues (completely understand). We then get informed that we have no pilot due to the airline overbooking his schedule (he went over on his hours and legally cannot fly a plane, completely understand). We then get informed we have a pilot and start boarding the plan at 11:20pm. We sat on the plane & tarmac until 12:40am, they then told us they couldn’t find another pilot and so our flight was cancelled. It is now currently 2am and we are still without our luggage (which has crucial personal medications on it). They refuse to give out meal / hotel vouchers as the flight was listed as cancelled due to “weather”. I am now watching children ages 0-18 sleeping on the floor of the airport. Also the American Airlines customer service is over a two hour wait. Staff was rude and not accommodating and told a young mother with two children to sleep on the airport floor."
387,"✅ Trip Verified | As per my last flight experience, I want to give 0 out 10 and if possible negative rating also especially for international travels. I don't recommend anyone for taking American airlines for international travels. I felt one of the worst customer care experiences ever. I missed my flight due to their backend and communication issues, even though its their issue, finally passenger need to suffer. They didn't even book other flight, because of that I almost suppose to miss my next two flights. Customer care didn't support even 1% percent also even when its their mistake. Funny thing is other AA partner airlines supervisor helped me in that critical situation. Finally I felt very bad for booking my international tickets in American airlines. After missing my first flight due to AA backend issues, since I didn’t have any other choice, I booked another next domestic flight to catch my international flight by paying higher price for ticket and luggage. Now AA still thinking to reimburse the rebooking flight charges also."
388,"Not Verified | I am a disabled navy veteran, my wife and I were traveling for our 10 year anniversary. So we went all out, we left the kids with the grand parents and booked first class tickets. Upon arrival in Vegas we went to claim our luggage and found that they destroyed it and lost half the contents. We filed a claim and started going through the process. We went on with our anniversary trying to get by with most of our belongings missing. Come about a week later they are refusing to do anything to make this right without original receipts for all the items missing and since I have communicated with them they have cut the window to turn in anything from 30 days to 15 days like I need any more pressure and hardship trying to find these reciepts. So if you want nothing but a headache and to get screwed in the end do not use this company."
389,"Not Verified | I have special dietary restrictions, so meal reservations take priority when flying. I have two complaints re this matter. 1. Due to faulty and misleading wording/information stated on website re meal reservation for flights, we are all wasting time. When contacting live reps, we are given inconsistent information. See below for reference: Site AND app state, in this exact wording: You can reserve a meal beginning 30 days (and up to 24 hours) before your flight. Available within 30 days of departure EVERY time Ive come across this issue, Im told its not available to reserve yet, even though its been 30 or less days prior to flight. Web techies could save us (and AA reps) time by adjusting this information to read less misleadingly. Idea: “You can reserve a meal up to 24 hours before your flight. (In select cases, this option may be available as early as 30 or less days before departure.)” Ive contacted them several times about this over the years. Nothing has changed. 2.They never have vegan options, only vegetarian. Most reps seem to not know the difference between the two. When I have had to speak with one over the phone, many times, Im given attitude, as if Im simply being picky and a nuisance. Veganism is more than just a diet - it’s an entire lifestyle, much like religious restrictions, such as kosher. I wonder if religious restrictions are given the same impatient attitude. I doubt it. Whats the problem with people who arent vegan getting so threatened with veganism? Im not preaching to them or trying to convert! Live and let live with respect. Solution: provide vegan options. Again, multiple times requests on this. No change. AA doesnt actually care about individuals, only their money."
390,"✅ Trip Verified | We were supposed to fly from RDU to CLT at 6am on 12/16 but at 3:30am we were notified the flight was cancelled due to winter weather in Charlotte. There was NO bad weather of any kind in Charlotte that day, and when we got to the airport to catch our new Delta flight we saw there was an AA flight that did in fact go to CLT that morning. The new flight they booked us on had us in Dallas to sit there all day and overnight! That is such an unacceptable rebooking - what are we supposed to do in an airport for 18+ hours!? And it was clearly a lie that the flight was cancelled due to winter weather so I want an answer as to why our flight was actually cancelled. This has created such distrust in American, and we are planning another trip to Cozumel (our final destination for the trip referenced) but will not be choosing American due to this experience. This created so much stress and hassle for us to cancel and rebook with another airline last second to make our planned hotel accommodations. And we had to fly into another airport and take an hour cab ride to catch a ferry to get to the island. American totally screwed up our vacation plans for NO reason and I want an answer."
391,"Not Verified |  Terrible from start to finish. My family of 5 (kids 10,8,6) flew out of Madison, WI to Punta Cana, DR. Our oldest has severe allergies to nuts and eggs. We asked them if they could make that announcement so people are careful and they said it is against their policy. When leaving the airplane luggage door was malfunctioning and not letting the pilot know it was closed. They needed to have a mechanic come and confirm it was closed. This took an hour for one to show up and sign some papers saying it was closed. After that delay we would arrive in Charlotte 20 minutes before our next flight landed. We did make our flight just in time and our flight to Punta Cana was fine. On our way back we again flew into Charlotte for a connecting flight. We landed at 7:00Pm, 15 minutes late giving us an hour and a half till our flight left to Madison. Customs and immigration were so backed that it took us an hour to have our passports check. We then ran to TSA to find that extremely backed up as well. After another 20 minutes in line we arrived at our gate 2 minutes late and the American Airlines agents refused to let us board. We needed to find another flight at the American Airlines booth. It was now 8:30PM when we started talking to the AA agents about a different flight. They told us the next one to Madison leaves the next day at 2:30PM. We asked if there was anything better they could do to route us through Chicago or Milwaukee because our 10yo has food allergies so eating will be difficult. The woman at the booth told us that she does not care how or what we feed our kids. Her job is to get us a new ticket and not to feed our kids. She ignored me not looking at me once and then handed me my tickets. I asked if we at least got a free hotel since it was going to be 18 hours till our plane left. She said no. It was your fault you missed your plane. AA wasn’t delayed. We then spent the next 18 hours at the airport waiting for our plane. We didn’t want to risk going through everything again. Our flight to Madison left 30 minutes late. When we got to Madison our bags were at AA baggage services which was not a designated area like Delta and United so we had to get inline at the check in counter where they had one person working. This took us another 30 minutes of waiting in line for them to give us our bags."
392,Not Verified |  Flight was delayed therefore I would've missed my connecting flight in Charlotte. The airline rebooked my flight without confirming the flight change with me. AA never took my bags off the original flight so now my bags are stuck in Charlotte and I'm on my way to Chicago then Vegas. None of the representatives at the airport knows what they're doing and seem all over the place. AA has a bad reputation for constant flight delays with no compensation. I definitely will never fly through American Airlines again and I will recommend that others do the same. You attempt to leave a day early and AA will still find a way to delay your flight.
393,"Not Verified |  We had planned a few days of vacation in Mysti Connecticut, the initial flight was at 11 am from Raleigh NC to PA and at 1:30 the connection from PA to Connecticut would leave, but, unfortunately we never arrived at the destination, the plane in Raleigh was It took 1 hour, they didn't give any reason for the delay, and when we got to the connection, the customer service girl said that she couldn't do anything, that the only option was to travel another day. Really, disappointed with the bad service. Due to the poor quality of service, we lost money on tickets, on hotels, on renting a car, and the people at American Airlines don't care if the customer misses the flights."
394,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew down to visit my parents. Arriving flight was late to arrive and late to disembark, made me late for my connection and I the missed my flight. Next flight wasn’t until 10:45, stranded at the airport and was only given a 12 dollar meal voucher. Flight continued to give updates from 10:45 to 01:00 the next day. Customer service could offer no further assistance."
395,"Not Verified | We had an amazing experience flying American from Detroit to Auckland, via Dallas, this December. Everything was strictly on time, we arrived almost 40 minutes early in Auckland, and the flight was so calm that I could not believe it. Moreover, for whatever reason, the plane was only half full, so we both had we extra seats to sleep a bit and landed in Auckland fresh and ready to explore. The crew was professional, the food was ok, the flight was perfect, nothing to complain. Thanks to the excellent crew that day."
396,"✅ Trip Verified |  Recently, my wife and I flew from Orlando to Seattle, with a layover in Phoenix, during the holiday season. We faced several issues that significantly impacted our journey, leading to disappointment with American Airlines. Flight Delay and Layover Missed: Initially informed in Orlando about a delay due to mechanical issues, we understood these things happen. However, this delay caused us to miss our connecting flight in Phoenix.  Miscommunication at the Counter: The representative in Orlando hastily rebooked us on the next morning’s flight. Despite our inquiries about alternative flights, even at our own additional expense, we were assured unnecessary and guaranteed seats on the next flight. This turned out to be misleading. Standby Tickets Without Notice: At our gate, we discovered our Phoenix to Seattle tickets were actually on standby - a critical detail omitted by the staff. When we called American Airlines, we were informed we were 17th in line on the standby list.  Altered Travel Plans and Additional Expenses: Our original arrival in Seattle was scheduled for 3 AM on December 23. Due to these changes, not only was our arrival delayed to 10 AM, but with the standby status, we wouldn’t depart from Phoenix until 3:20 PM. This forced us to incur unexpected hotel expenses.  Unacknowledged Paid Seat Upgrades: We had paid an extra $100 for better seats for our Phoenix to Seattle flight. Given our standby status, this seems like an expense unlikely to be refunded.  Lack of Transparency and Assistance: The situation was exacerbated by a lack of honest communication from the beginning. When explaining our situation, the response from American Airlines was unhelpful, offering no compensation, such as a food voucher, or a genuine apology.  Final Decision: This experience has profoundly affected our view of American Airlines. Despite my wife’s cousin being a pilot for the airline, we are deeply disappointed. We expected more from an airline with a history of poor reviews. The lack of customer service and poor communication has led us to decide against using American Airlines in the future, regardless of cost."
397,Not Verified |  I bought my tickets months in advance for 22 December 2023 at 2:07pm. I got to the airport at 9am to ensure I wasn't late only to find out they had changed it to 5:30 in the morning. Apparently they had sent emails but I wasn't aware until after the fact. Now I have to wait until 1159pm. They need to call you within a certain time frame if you haven't acknowledged their drastic time changes via email.
398,"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to late incoming flight we were supposed to depart with roughly 1 hour delay. Expected delay was communicated via email and text. Due to well organized boarding we ended up leaving and arriving with only half an hour delay. Check in at YYZ was as usual fast, friendly, efficient and pleasant. Boarding was civilized which unfortunately is not always the case. Crew on board was great. All in all a nice experience."
399,"Not Verified |  I had to cancel my flight 3 days prior to taking off, due to medical reasons. A nice lady at American Airlines customer service advised me to ask for a trip credit to temporarily delay the date of travel, because I had until February 3rd to book anywhere else. She didn't advise me that my cash value of the tickets could change? This is stealing in my language and taking advantage of clients. On top of having a health problem at the time of flight, I am losing 1300$ because they decide to credit me 151$ per person. I was not made aware of this nor was I advised I would lose a substantial amount of money. I was told that I had until February 3rd and I am still within that delay. I am not asking for a refund. I was simply asking to delay the date of February 3rd to an alternate date. Without having to loose all of my cash value. All I want is to book a trip with my full value of 1600 before February 3rd, and they won't give my cash value back.  What does it take to have the full value and amount of the tickets back. This is not good customer service and I will not let this go and will make sure I am within my right to use the full amount I have paid originally. I am disgusted with their customer service."
400,"✅ Trip Verified |  Had a flight from Madrid to London on British airways, we spent the night in London and the next day we checked in with American Airlines with undamaged bags, but when arrived to Chicago 2 bags were destroyed cracked, dented, and missing wheels. Also the item inside were destroyed, it make it clear that these people don’t care about our belongings, so I made the report at the counter and I was told to send the claim online. Which I did, later I got an email from AA baggage center saying that they spoke with British Airways and they agree to replace my bags, few weeks passed without answer so I called British Airways to inquire and they so it’s AA responsibility and of course I went back to AA and theyve been bouncing me back and fourth for at least 4 times, last call I had was the British and I get them because the damage was done on an AA flight but these people been misleading me for 3 months now shame on you American Airlines. "
401,✅ Trip Verified | The woman who did our check-in was friendly and efficient. The boarding process by staff was efficient however many passengers ignored requests to check cabin baggage if they had more than 2 items and this did slow departure slightly but we still pushed back 2 mins early. On board the crew were friendly & did drink / snack runs through the night without disturbing passengers resting. Our baggage was checked through to Stockholm - our final destination at all of our checked luggage arrived safely. The only negative things I can mention are that the seats were showing signs of age & did not recline far. I would not want to be in this seat for a long haul flight (more than 7 hours).
402,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst, the customer Service, cabin crew, specially main desk & boarding desk staffs at the airport are rude and unhelpful. All they care about their profit not customers. They rolled us twice which spoiled our 1 day of tour. Second although flights are expensive but there was no good Service or amenities. Never gonna waste my money in American Airlines."
403,"✅ Trip Verified |  The flights are always delayed. Save your time, money and effort and stay away from this airline. Do not book a flight with them if you have a connection or if you need to be at your destination on time! My flight from SFO to phoenix was delayed (just waiting on the airplane). And the next flight was closed early but the plane just laid there for a lot of time. They intentionally want you to lose your flight because then they say it’s due to air traffic and won’t give you any vouchers for food or hotel. Your spot is already taken by someone else because they oversell tickets. And then they book you to the earliest flight the next day. My next morning flight was the same story. We were waiting for over an hour inside the airplane and I was terribly nervous because to lose a very important appointment. I couldn’t recommend them less. "
404,"Not Verified |  American Airlines didn’t let us keep our one small carry-on bag. We’re a family of 4, and we had 3 backpacks and one bag that we were taking on the flight with us, but they refused to let us take our bag because there “wasn’t any space for it.” That bag had important medicine in it, and we had to repack it right before boarding. That bag was very small, not overweight or anything, and could’ve probably fit under the seat. Lo and behold, when we went on the plane, there was plenty of space to put it overhead. American Airlines had terrible customer service, and the gate agents had no empathy and just told us to rebook our flight or check the bag in. We couldn’t rebook because we had 2 more connecting flights after that, and who’s to say that that flight would have enough space? We even asked if we could have the bag back after our first flight, but the gate agent ladies were incompetent and didn’t even listen to us. Passengers are entitled to have one carry on bag each, and the gate agents told us to get priority seating, which obviously isn’t free. American Airlines is a terrible company and really needs to improve their customer service."
405,"Not Verified |  During my travels from Arizona to Ohio in October, my custom luggage tag was lost. It wasn't expensive but a very cute, rubber dog shaped luggage tag. Two months later, I received an envelope from an employee of American airlines returning my tag. He stated they found it on the tarmac and wanted to return it. The return address was his personal address with postage paid, I assume by the employee. I found this this gesture extremely kind and thoughtful. He went out of his way to return the tag (even send a new strap). Bravo for customer service."
406,"✅ Trip Verified |  We recently traveled from Roatan, Honduras to Las Vegas, NV on flight #796 with a connection in Miami to Las Vegas flight #726 on December 12, 2023 on American Airlines. Our flight out of Roatan arrived almost 30 minutes late which left only an hour and a half to make our connection to Las Vegas. Even though we ran as fast as late 60's year old people could, we got to our gate at 7:16pm for a 7:29pm departure only to find that the attendants had already closed the gate and wouldn't reopen it. Apparently, they have a policy of closing the gate 15 minutes prior to the departure time - the hell with the customers that had been delayed by their own airline. My guess is to make sure they boost their ""on time arrival"" statistics. We went to the customer service desk to discuss alternatives to find out that our bags had made the flight. It's inconceivable to me that. with the technology available and in use, they wouldn't cross check the bags with the passengers and realize that there had been a delay. The customer service attendant and I spent almost an hour looking for flights and discussing options to finally determine that the next available flight that made any sense would be the next day. Because of the miles of red tape and caveats of American Airlines missed flight because of delays policy, we were informed that lodging and food would not be paid for - it was going to be our cost. So, at about 9:00pm we found a hotel near the airport. I have been a loyal flyer of American Airlines in the past while I was working and traveling extensively. In fact, they were the first frequent flyer program I joined back in the 1980's and I was platinum level for many years. At one time, American was the premier customer service oriented airline flying. I sought them out because of their exemplary service and customer mindset. Unfortunately, they have devolved into one of the worst when it comes to that! They are more expensive than most, and their policies are nothing short of criminal. They have followed the pack in charging for bags (still at the top of the most ridiculous fees in the history of ripoffs), and become no better than Frontier or Spirit when it comes to charging extra for certain seats. It used to be at least they didn't charge for the economy seats when you checked in after 24 hours in advance. Now it was a $10-12 fee to choose a seat during that time! We originally booked the flights for the economy fare of $711. A couple of months later they had dropped to $552 and, since economy bookers have zero rights, we couldn't cancel and rebook. You would think that an airline making gazillions of dollars anyway would see fit to pay for a hotel and food when they made an additional $320 from us. It's virtually impossible to contact a real person from American and, even if I did, I would get the stock, scripted answer regarding their policies. I don't think it's unreasonable for them to reimburse my costs of around $125 for them causing us to have to stay overnight after missing the flight. But customer service and common sense have disappeared from the airline industry. That's why I will never fly American again and give Southwest my business - no baggage nor change fees and they at least make an attempt at providing good customer service and experiences."
407,"✅ Trip Verified |  Never had a worst experience then this one. They split our family into far apart seats, they were not even close. We never asked or were not picky but splitting us into corners is so not an experience i would ever want again. They had overbooked the flight and could in no manner manage to fit the luggage, there was no order in which they could control the boarding process. After our bags were put, a flight attendants comes and says your bag cannot fit & you need to bring it all the way in the front. I asked for his help to bring it down as i am 5’0 and its hard to pull without hurting other passages. My husband had help me load it (who was split to a further front location). Staff said its your problem I am not here to help you with anything. I have travelled Europe, Australia, South Asia, Egypt & much more bur have never come across a flight attendant who has hesitant to help. Forget helping he was rude & loud. I in my life would never travel American Airlines again. "
408,Not Verified |  American Airlines has the worst customer service of all Airlines. I have never seen employees so rude that can't help resolve simple issues. Everytime there was an issue to arise they always say there is nothing they can do about it. I have booked with them twice and both times have been awful experiences.
409,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline experience ever in my life. Was denied boarding my flight at Havana airport last week. Flown with them late last month from Miami to Havana. Upon arrival at their desk at the Havana airport to board my return flight to Miami (then should have been in Miami same day) was flying back to Brisbane via San Francisco. Was told that my esta is invalid and will need to book a whole different flights They mentioned this situation happens every day and not in their policy to advise of the travel requirements. Lost over $3000 AUD because of their shameful and disgraceful policy. Should have been advised when I booked in September this flight, would have avoided visiting Cuba. And they are not refunding me for the loss. The American Airlines help desk even at the Jose Martí Havana airport themselves said ( It s a shame). Surely it is not just a shame but disgusting and horrible experience they been delivering daily to travellers just like me. Never again flying with American Airlines"
410,"Not Verified |  Absolute worst travel and customer service experience of my life. I will never fly American Airlines again! Our flight out of Omaha got delayed 8 hours, causing us and almost everyone else on board to either miss connections, or miss their cruise ships out of Miami. The staff at the airport was rude and refused to answer any questions on why we were delayed and for how long. By the time they decided to let us all know when the flight would be leaving, there was no chance to book with another airline and still make our connections. Of course, AA had no other flights to the Grand Caymans that day, so they booked us a room in Miami and scheduled us on the first flight out of Miami the next morning. When we arrived at the hotel that AA had booked for us, the police were raiding the hotel, there were bullet holes in the floor, the place was filthy, and there was no way I was going to stay there. We called AA to have them change hotels for us and we were informed that they couldn't do anything over the phone, that we would need to go back to Miami International and find an AA customer service desk to get a hotel change, otherwise we were welcome to find a hotel on our own and save the receipt and AA would reimburse us. Fine. By this time, we had been ""traveling"" (not that I would call it that) for over 18 hours and decided to just find a hotel close to the airport and call it a night. It was 8:30 pm at this time. We got a hotel and back to the airport the next morning. The flight the next morning seemed to be going smoothly until they got everyone on board and backed away from the gate. We then sat on the tarmac for over an hour and a half with no air conditioning (apparently the mechanical issue was the air conditioner). It ended up being over 90 degrees inside this airplane that was over packed. The entire time, we sat and listened to the staff laugh, joke, and complain about the ""bonuses"" they all had just received for the holiday.  Zero professionalism and rude to customers who were asking for water due to the excessive heat inside the aircraft. When we finally made it back from our trip, we submitted the request to be refunded for the hotel, our meals, and the hotel and excursion we had booked in the Caymans but were unable to make it to. AA customer relations representative would not accept some of our receipts, offered us a $200 trip credit to fly AA again and sent a check that was not even half the cost of the hotel room ($142), much less any other of our expenses. When I complained to customer relations again, I was informed that the amount I was refunded was the ""policy amount"" set for that date and location. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the person I was speaking to was the last person I would speak to, there are no supervisors, and no other departments above them. I cannot believe that an airline allows this to happen. I haven't even mentioned in this review how rude the gate and flight attendants were throughout the entire trip, or that our return trip was delayed for over an hour as well. Absolutely the worst! Do not fly American Airlines."
411,"Not Verified |  Upon boarding the plane, the staff scanning my ticket told me my carry on was too big and to put it in the bag tryin. Fly with this bag regularly. My bag slid in with squishing my bag ever so slightly. She said it was too big because it touched the bar. So I took out my jacket out and that made the difference. I put my jacket back in my bag when I got on the plane and still had 3 inches of space above my bag. After an hour delay sitting on the plane due to a repair (understandably) the announcer comes over the intercom and says to the cabin “if the stewardess ask you to do anything don’t give them any trouble"" first time in 40 years I’ve heard such a lovely random comment. AA you need to have better customer service training for these rude people. Thanks for taking my money. "
412,✅ Trip Verified | There was no water or drink offered in first class until 45 minutes into our first delayed flight. There was no screen available for TV or movies in first class. The airline did not state the reason for our delay. Airline rebooked our connecting flight that we missed since our first flight was delayed for unknown reasons. Their rebooking added a leg and then did not get us in on time (again) for a different connecting flight. This has been a hot mess.
413,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight left on time and arrived early. Pleasant onboard experience with very pleasant, friendly, helpful flight attendant. We had a pet in cabin and as usually with AA the experience was not stressful and very nice."
414,"✅ Trip Verified | Horrific. The gate agents decided to close the gate 20 minutes early for their convenience. I explained my neck is broken, which can clearly be seen, and my immediate family member just died. I also explained my Father is very sick and this would be his last birthday. I had documents to show this was true. They said they didn’t care, and would book a flight 12 hours later, that would cause me to miss seeing my family. I also cannot sit in airports for hours through multiple changes because I am in excruciating pain. They said they didn’t care, and I showed proof I am going into surgery in 5 days. They didn’t care. Said they might give me a refund, but didn’t know if they would. Thank you American for once again letting me down when I needed you to respond like rational human beings. I may never see my Dad again, except at his funeral. I’ll make sure to send you his obituary, and will make sure not to count on you to get me there."
415,"✅ Trip Verified |  I wanted to reach out to describe an experience my daughter had with American Airlines. My daughter just turned 18 years old. Epileptic and has service dog. We purchased a seat for her trained seizure response animal (not an emotional support animal), as she felt with her dogs size, 72lbs, she needed her own seat so as to not bother anyone. When she arrived at the airport at 4:30pm for a 7:35pm flight, she received a message that the flight from PIT to DCA  as well as her flight from DCA to Hartford was canceled. It happens. She got into Charlotte approximately 10:30pm and had 12 minutes to get to the next flight. She was a little panicked as she had to get to the other side of the airport for the connecting flight. But she ran, with her dog. She arrived at the gate D13 and saw people standing around and thought she would be called to get on the flight. She sat down and waited. Looking on her phone. After a few minutes, she looked up and saw a sign that said Gate Closed. She went to the gate and the two women there and asked why there was no announcement. One started laughing, the other said well you were walking away, obviously they saw her. My daughter was mocked, laughed at and when one asked about her dog, the other in air quotes ""oh that's her service dog"" My final comment is; shame on them. My daughter is a kind, unselfish and respectful person. She was by your employees, humiliated, embarrassed and shamed for having a disability. Again, shame on them."
416,"Not Verified |  We will never fly American Airlines again. First of all we have always had problems with this company to begin with as every time we have flown American they have always delayed our flights, Our last flight with them returning from Cancun was delayed 6 hours without compensation. Ruined our return to work the following day. The real reason and issue we Will never fly with them again was our recent flight due on Dec 2. It was cancelled on us 11/30 (less than 48 hours before) with a mere email and excuses from both the representatives and supervisor I spoke with who were exceptionally rude. I asked to take the same flight they cancelled on me which was available for same price and was told it was not their problem. Really horrible treatment and ruined our trip just 2 days before. We are two physicians who fly all the time for business, pleasure, and fun. We always offer to assist or help on flights whenever we travel if needed. To be treated this way is so unacceptable and unprofessional for such a ""large"" company."
417,"Not Verified |  Me and my fiancé were supposed to be on a cruise for our Engagement. We booked our flights with American Airlines and downloaded the app to keep watch for updates. Monitored the app for days and even hrs/mins leading up to boarding. Their website/app allows you to see where the plane you will be flying on came in from and when it landed at MCI our aircraft landed at MCI 11/25/23 at 4:32pm from CANCUN, the next morning when they were loading us multiple passengers asked to make sure we would be taking off on time because we did have some snow (it stopped around 1am) including myself we were reassured that yes we would be taking off on time. When all passengers were on board the Pilot announced take off in 15mins ... 30 mins later and we still had not moved .. 1 hr later still had not moved and nothing was said passengers started to question the flight attendants who didn't know what was going on. 2 hrs in and the pilot announces that our plane had not been refuelled in the 15 hrs that it sat at the airport so we were waiting, next thing he comes on and says they notified him that our plane was never de-iced. He lets us know that they are short staffed as well and now he does not know when we will be taking off. Multiple passengers wanted off, including us and we were denied being able to get off the aircraft that was still at the terminal to book other options. 3 1/2 hrs later we finally arrived in Chicago we missed all connecting flight to our cruise. Were forced to wait in the airport for hours for a return flight and now American Airlines is trying to say that they do not owe anyone any type of compensation and not to mention they are robbing me of my time, money and returning flights that went unused. "
418,"✅ Trip Verified |  I will never book with this airline again. I was supposed to travel to Phoenix for a conference. A few days before I was leaving with my friend her sister suffered a tragic death. I reached out to see what could be done and at first i was told nothing. Then after hearing the alderman's of the situation they agreed to refund our tickets as long as I provided a death certificate, obituary and note on letter head from the funeral home stating the relationship of the deceased. Imagine the embarrassment of having to ask for these things when her and her family were grieving. Then even though I was told both tickets would be refunded they only refunded one. It's shameful to think that this is how people treat another human in times of loss and grief. I hope who ever decides to process refunds never has the humiliation of what this company put me through. It's shameful and they should be embarrassed to be a part of this company."
419,"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst airline ever. My son is graduating from basic training tomorrow and we are going to miss everything because of American Airlines. The airline completely ruined this experience for our children and for the family, our kids that we have not seen in 2 months and they are going to be looking for our faces tomorrow during their run and we will not be there for them because of American Airlines."
420,"Not Verified |  One of the most upsetting experiences ever. My sibling and I were returning home via an overnight flight. The flight attendants were rude to us and even tapped my sibling's shoulder to properly put the objects under the seats, even though she was clearly sleeping. While the flight went smoothly and we landed safely, we ended up getting stuck in the plane for an hour. We weren't even informed what was happening until last minute, when they said they were having trouble with the gates. And then we ended up waiting even more and they continue to fail to inform what was happening. They were arguing with the ones running the gate and they are completely unprofessional. And then, we had to wait for our bags to come out to the conveyor belt for a long time as well. We arrived in Newark at 4:40. It took us up until 6:40 for us to finally get out of the airport. Would never go back to that airline ever again."
421,✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines needs to step up their game. Domestic aircrafts are not equipped with passenger’s monitor/entertainment. It becomes torture to sit in the cabin during flights and especially delays (which happen not infrequently)
422,"Not Verified | Worst Experience during a time of sorrow. Booked with American with a connecting flight via Contour. Contour cancelled the flight on 27 Oct into PAH. Was offered a new flight into Evansville, IN or Nashville TN at 6:30PM, this flight was 6 Hours after my original flight was to depart. Why does that time matter, the time of sorrow was my fathers wake was 5-8PM, I was due to arrive in PAH at 12:45PM. The flights into Evansville and Nashville did not arrive until the same time as the next PAH flight at 7:45PM, the next PAH was was supposedly sold out. Flying into the 2 offered locations would require 2+ hrs driving and $500 in rental car expense, on a flight I could have booked through Southwest, Nonstop and $400 cheaper. Here is the issue, American Desk Agents, Phone agents, and Contour Phone Agents simply refused to contact each other. American rebooked me on the Nashville flight, without my knowledge, and Contour stating they can not make changes to American Itineraries, creating 6+ hrs of phone time between both Airlines, hobbling across 2 terminals on crutches to get to my family, In the end, I was forced to buy a 2nd seat on Contour, on a flight that was ""Sold Out"" to be told, I had 2 seats 20 minutes before boarding, which contour refused to refund, because I was cancelling within 24 hrs of the flight, but only 15 minutes after being told I didn’t have a seat. American and Contour refused to contact each other and American refused to talk to a Contour REP I had on the phone. Total 8 hrs on a 45 minute layover, $800+ dollars and a flight credit on an airline that flys no where. And what else - American refuses to entertain my refund request, stating it is Contours issue and American refuses to reply to any message. American Airlines Customer Service Agents on Terminal C on 3 NOV were the rudest, most unprofessional customers service REPs I have ever experienced."
423,"Not Verified |  The flight was punctual, and the cabin crew was friendly and attentive. The in-flight service exceeded my expectations, with delicious meal and complimentary beverages. The seating was comfortable, and the entertainment options made the journey enjoyable. What impressed me the most was the proactive communication from the airline about any potential delays."
424,"✅ Trip Verified | American is repeatedly guilty of “trickle-truthing” passengers and not giving them accurate information. My flight was supposed to depart at 2:13. The plane arrived, passengers departed — but 2:13 came without any announcement. Then they posted 2:30. Then 2:53. 2:53 came and weren’t with no boarding. No announcements. People lined up at 2:00, relinquishing their seats in a crowded terminal, only to stand about with no updates from American. We need more competition in the US instead of the oligopoly that controls nearly everything. At least the Southwest people try to be nice. Not so at American. "
425,"✅ Trip Verified |  I pre booked 4 people (Myself, My wife whom speaks English and her two boys that only speak German) to fly from Munich Germany to Nashville TN USA back in June 8,2023 at 04:07 for 3200€. For October 16, 2023 our flight from MUC to CLT was a good flight. However from CLT to BNA was where it all started. We all went through customs within 30 minutes Myself on the USA side and my wife and her two boys on the other entering the USA I was surprised they made it through so quickly. We had to grab are bags and recheck them with American to continue are flight to Nashville and go through TSA check point smooth sailing without a hitch. Once we arrived to are gate it all started!. Are flights was AA 1059 to arrive Nashville at 03:08:pm once at the gate we where told the flight had been over booked and we would have to wait for standby I told them I had prepaid 6 months in advance for this flight and we where expected in Nashville on time as a family of 4. I also stated that the people in are seats should go on standby not us. American only told me we where put on stand by and to take it up with customer service. We had waited over 5-hours on standby each time we where told flight was overbooked, Finally two seats came available around 0630 pm and the boys said they would get the next two seat that came up. My wife an I arrived in Nashville at 0930 pm and had to call a friend to pick us up. My wife received a message from the boys that they may need to get a hotel since it wasn’t looking good By now I’m extremely furious at 0345 am the boys finally arrived in Nashville and had to pay $160 for an Uber to get to us. Our return flight from Nashville to London to Munich we arrived 3-hours in advance in case any issues came up, Thank god we did! For some reason American booked one of are boys 9 times on the same flight with (Partner airlines) British Airways we where walking back n fourth between the 2 to get it taken care of, this went on for two times and I said enough is enough American has to work this out with British Airways, not us of walking back and forth. After 2 1/2 hours they got it worked out and we almost missed our flight. Once in London we had a 5-hour layover and everything went great with British Airways and our flight to Munich . I have reached out to American Airlines and all I get is a email saying we received your concerns and we are working on it. I would have expected better service from American than this This is unacceptable!."
426,"Not Verified |   I recently had an experience with American Airlines that truly reaffirmed my loyalty to their services. On Monday, 11/13/2023, I accidentally left my bag on the economy bus after a flight and didn't realize it until four days later. The subsequent hour of frantic calls and coordination was a testament to the exceptional customer service provided by American Airlines. What impressed me the most was the efficiency with which my bag was recovered and returned to me. Thanks to the tag on my bag that identified it as mine, the bag was promptly located and brought back into the airline's possession. This incident highlighted the dedication and commitment of American Airlines to ensuring the well-being of their passengers and their belongings. The seamless coordination between the different departments involved in this process showcased a well-organized and customer-centric approach. The fact that I only fly American Airlines speaks volumes about the reliability and trustworthiness I have come to associate with this airline. In an industry where hiccups can occur, it's the response and resolution that truly matter, and American Airlines went above and beyond to rectify the situation swiftly and with utmost professionalism. This incident has solidified my confidence in American Airlines, and I will continue to choose them for my future travels. "
427,"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst people to fly with, never be there in time, that’s if your lucky and didn’t miss your connection. Always they have something to delay and they deal with you like they do a favor for you? "
428,"Not Verified |  American Airlines has become a cheap airline that just nickels & dimes it’s passengers. Missed my connecting flight, because flight arrived late, for whatever reason. Best offer when rebooking at the counter initially was a rebooked flight for the next day at 3:30pm, with no hotel accommodation. The excuse was because the flight wasn’t delayed. Though no fault of my own, I was just supposed to eat the cost of the hotel stay. I had to ask the agent to rebook on another flight to a city close to my destination. American Airlines is a 3rd rate carrier. I won’t be flying it again for any reason."
429,"Not Verified |  Buyer Beware of American Airlines. Terrible experience again. Booked 6 tickets months ago and without notice, they delayed us by nearly 3 hours with no notification, no explanation, no compensation, no refund to get on a different airline. What happened to customer service or is it only service for the seller? Have 4 other trips planned for the next 6 months (Several with large groups) Will not even be looking at American Airlines!"
430,"✅ Trip Verified | Well, other than a seat that swivels there is nothing “first” about this experience. Service was ok, food was ok and seat was ok. As American is discontinuing this cabin next year they have clearly given up on trying to elevate the experience. As a business class flight, this would be very good but as first - it fails. The only first class moment was provided by Qantas in their top notch first class lounge. Honestly, until the cabins are retrofitted these seats should just be offered as a perk in business class for high mileage status holders. Truly a rip off of either $ or miles."
431,"Not Verified |  Horrible experience trying to fly home internationally. AA overbooked by 9 seats, so only 2 of my 4 seats were available. They split my family up & sent my children on another plane without me. Customer service was awful & no communication about this issue. I had to keep inquiring as the employees carried on & laughed while my children boarded a plane without me. In addition, they had no issues charging me for luggage even though they gave my confirmed seat away. Apparently this airline is known for doing this so fly with someone else!!"
432,"✅ Trip Verified |  Did a r/t Philadelphia to Madrid in Oct/Nov 2023 and quite honestly can say it was one of the worst airline trips I have ever experienced and I have travelled extensively around the world in the past 30 years. The cabin crew were unfriendly and downright rude to passengers in economy. The food was terrible and fit only for pigs. Looks like AA cabin crew are coached to treat economy class passengers as 2nd class citizens. The good is that the flights were on time and arrived at destinations safely. Needless to say, avoid AA if you can."
433,Not Verified |  We experienced wonderful service by crew and ground staff. Onboard wifi and snacks. No delays. Departed on time. Though Santa Fe airport was small the staff gave the checked-in baggage as soon as possible. great value for money as well. Seat and legroom was comfortable too. Will definitely fly with them again!
434,"✅ Trip Verified |  3 flights there and 3 flights back. On the way there 2 flights were delayed over 2 hours because of maintenance. On the way back my middle flight from Charlotte to Fargo was delayed due to more “maintenance” - let’s call it what it is tho, incompetence. So now I have 11 hours to sit around in Chicago. I wasn’t planning on this so I need to pay for lunch and dinner. On top of the fact my dog will be staying at the kennel an additional day as my flight won’t make it home until late. So that’s an additional 100 for picking up my dog a day late, plus lunch and dinner I wasn’t planning on spending. No discount, no upgrade, no nothing. Just a generic “sorry” Just pure incompetence from the worst airline I have ever flown and will never fly again. Avoid this failing company like the plague and fly with any other airline, even spirit airlines is better than this kindergarten level of quality of service."
435,Not Verified | The worst airline ever. I had to catch 4 different aircraft because of “technical issues”. I missed the 3 connecting flights and they had us waiting for hours! How is it possible that the 3 aircraft have technical issues and we had to wait for maintenance to clear the issue? I’m currently on another connecting flight and there is another technical issue waiting to be cleared. Unacceptable.
436,"✅ Trip Verified | This was a very short flight from Charlotte North Carolina to Philadelphia. We were under an hour and 20 minutes in the air. We left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Having recently flown about the same distance or a little bit more on a Boeing 737 MAX 800 I have to say that the Airbus A321 feels a little bit more roomier. We did not have service on this flight due to turbulence, but the crew made an announcement that if anyone needed anything that they could request. I continue to be a big fan of the free Wi-Fi that I get through my cell phone provider that makes the time go so much faster even in bad turbulent weather. Overall American delivered a consistent, safe and on-time product. Thank you AA!"
437,"Not Verified |  If you are traveling across the United States, do not take this airline. There were so many delays for the revisits or go back home. The recent airplane we are in there was no AC, the pilots were missing and our 11:00pm flight was delayed to the point we have to wait until 6:00am to arrive back home. If you want to travel, you’re better off taking another airline."
438,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines took me from Philadelphia to Charlotte safe and on time. Our flight left on time and arrived 30 minutes ahead of schedule, the crew was efficient during service, WIFI on board worked great, and it was free with my cell phone provider. I’ve recently flown on a 737 Max 8 and I feel the A321 was a bit more roomier. Overall nothing negative to say. Good job AA!"
439,"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband I were scheduled to fly from Las Vegas to Germany via London. Our flight to USA as well as back to Europe was booked with British Airways, but as it always is flights within the USA are operated with a partner company, which in this case was American Airlines. Vegas to Dallas departed on November 4th. We were late departing to begin with (about 30 minute late departure). Still we weren't as concerned. Upon landing in Dallas our plane started driving around the runway - driving and driving and driving. Panic started, not only for us but many other passengers on the flight who were connecting thru Dallas. After 35 minutes, the pilot finally pulls up at the gate and tells us that the reason for the delayed parking is the fact that he was given the wrong gate when we landed to from terminal A he had to drive all the way to Terminal D. Is there anyone waiting for us at the gate to pick us up and transfer us to our departing gate considering our flight is already boarding? No. We are left to run like mad, dashing across the whole entire terminal in order to get to our gate. 30 passengers from our flight are trying to get onto British Airways flight to London. Finally we get there only to be told that we can not board as the gate has been closed (plane is still sitting there!). After 1.5 hrs in the queue, We get re-scheduled on a flight to London for the next day. However, not on the British Airways flight in a Premium economy as our initial booking but we get put on an AA flight, in economy seats, with a fold out table that's barely hanging on the hinges and our food tray is leaning at at a 30 degree angle when placed on the table. My husband and I are literally supporting the table with our knees so we can have our meal. Absolute nightmare of a return flight which brought us home with 26 hour delay. Never again!"
440,"Not Verified |  The personnel at K16 gate working flight AA1200 around 11:45 am were extremely unprofessional and selective on who to harass. One of the ladies in her ignorant wisdom decided that my backpack, which standing next to a carry on is smaller, was too big. She made me waste time. I feel she took out her frustration of a full flight on me. Her assessment was unfounded."
441,"Not Verified |  First of all, I had to drive around for over an hour to find parking. I finally parked and had 1 hour to get to my gate. When I checked in they told me that I was too late and issued me a stand by flight. With 45 minutes until my flight? This is unacceptable because I had plenty of time to get to the gate and board, but because they gave my flight to someone else. I have to be In Oklahoma today for a wedding rehearsal and wedding, so now I don’t know if I will make it. Very disappointed. Never had this issue with Southwest Airlines. Sorry to say that I will never use this airline again."
442,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight AA674 on November 7th 2023 was a nightmare. We were stuck in the plane for 2 hours in scorching hot and sunny 91 F weather. While waiting in the airplane, airline crew never served us any cold drinks. For the 2 hour waiting period, we got only several updates from pilot staff. First update was , ""We are waiting for tech to show up and complete safety log"". Next update was 1 hour later , ""The tech arrived and did the checks but he can't log in into online log system."" Another half an hour later, the pilot said, ""We decided to do paper log because we couldn't figureout online log system"". It took them 1.5 hour to realize paper form exists! Every company has downtime forms. Does American airline company know that there is such a thing as downtime forms.  Why does it take a big company like Americans Airlines 1.5 hour to figure it logging? Next update from pilot we got 2 hours after scheduled take off time, ""Sorry for delay. We had technical issues with oxygen tanks, so that's why you had to wait all this time. We are replacing 5 oxygen tanks on our airplane."" So why couldn't the pilot be honest in the beginning? As a customer, I deserve to have a truthful update from airline staff. This incident definitely broke my trust in American Airlines. Being stuck in hot and full airplane for 2 hours with no attempts of the staff to do anything about it to alleviate the discomfort was utterly humiliating. Not to mention that we missed our connecting flight because of very long and painful flight delay."
443,"Not Verified |  
I've always considered AA to be generic standard quality at reasonable price, and have never been disappointed on that note. I can't really think of anything special either positive or negative. I have had some delayed baggage on occasion, as I did the most recent time. It was returned to me within 24hrs. I watched a bag handler just leave the doors open on the trolley and drop bags out of it this same trip. That's about it, really just mid-tier every which way. I've never had a major issue with them, so that's positive enough. Can't remember a serious flight delay or cancellation, and I probably fly with them twice a year. I would say their seats are a bit above average on comfort, though with limited recline of like 5 degrees. You don't get much food with them, though, really underwhelming. Did a 4hr flight and got a cookie."
444,"Not Verified | Avoid this airline like the plague. Our layover in DFW turned into a nightmare when the announcement came over the PA that our plane was there, the pilots were there but they didnt have any flight crew. The flight was delayed until they finally announced that the flight had been cancelled. We had to wait over an hour and a half to talk to a customer service agent and they informed us there was no way to get us to Newark but they could send us to New York and my party of four would be split up in middle seats across the plane. When I told them that we have a child with us they told us its that or nothing. So we ended up having to drive halfway across the country home. When I reached out via phone to AA to try to figure out a refund situation they blatantly lied and stated the flight was cancelled due to weather and there was no staffing issue. If you dare to take this awful flight provider do yourself a favor and RECORD everything they say. They are liars and will try to keep everything and offer nothing. "

446,"Not Verified |  American Airlines has become the worse airline to fly with. Canceled our flight last minute do to over booking, had attitude and were unapologetic when we tried to find alternate flights. Flight attendant spilled hot coffee on me during the flight and didn't even Apologize until we landed. They somehow didn't put our checked bags under the plane and now we're getting nowhere trying to track the bags down. None of their employees we've encountered have any idea what customer service is. This airline is a joke and we will never fly with them again."
447,"✅ Trip Verified |  Had a connecting flight from Phoenix and was directed to my gate L6a. Once seated at the gate I noticed it was getting close to flight time and no airline employee’s were at the gate. I then went to another desk to ask them what was going on and they informed me my flight had been moved to the other side of the airport! They said I had 20 minutes to get there I better hurry. I ran across the whole airport in 10 minutes when I got to my new gate the flight had left. It was 4:52, the flight time was 5:07. I asked why they’d left early even though I heard the gate agent ask them to wait for me and it was no answer. I checked my email and text and there was no notification of a gate change. There was also no notification on the screen at L6a. Because of all of this I asked them for a flight credit which of course they refused! "
448,"✅ Trip Verified |  I regret to say that my recent experience with American Airlines was incredibly disappointing. My journey on October 26, 2023, was plagued by significant flight delays and a complete lack of communication regarding my connecting flight in Dallas. I had to initiate multiple calls to their customer service department, but the responses were marked by incompetence and indifference. The reasons given for the delays ranged from crew no-shows to inaccurate weather-related explanations, and I even had a representative hang up on me when I inquired about alternative flight options. As a result, I had to take matters into my own hands to secure an alternative flight, causing me to miss dinner reservations and a significant portion of my vacation plans. This is unacceptable and does not align with the level of service I expected. The return journey on October 30, 2023, was no better, with unexplained delays during my layover in Dallas leading to further disruptions. Customer service on October 31 was dismissive and offered no compensation, insisting that the airline fulfilled its duty merely by getting me to my destination ""without harm or injury."" The entire experience left me disillusioned. American Airlines displayed a shocking lack of coordination, communication, and accountability. It's vital that they acknowledge their responsibility in these matters. I expect a thorough investigation and fair compensation for the disruptions I experienced. I strongly urge American Airlines to improve their customer service, communication, and accountability to prevent others from enduring similar ordeals. It is my hope that they will take prompt action to address these issues and restore customer trust. I await their response, hoping for a more positive outcome and a resolution to these issues."
449,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had nothing but an exceptionally positive experience. I am not sure whether the airline is much better with their long haul flights versus domestic flights (where most of the complaints seem to be about) or whether I just got lucky. The flight was on-time (actually pushed back a few minutes early). The check in experience was very good at MIA airport. I was able to use Flagship First check in as a Oneworld Emerald and was escorted to the front of the security line by the agent. The AA Flagship lounge is fantastic. As I had arrived at the airport straight from a cruise at 9:30am I had a lot of time to kill until my 4:30pm flight. The lounge is really beautifully presented, light, and food and beverage options were vastly superior to say the BA or Iberia lounges at their home hubs. The cabin/seats. We ended up having one of the forward/rearward configured aircraft and I was a little hesitant about whether i'd like this set up but the seats were great and the cabin was stylish and refined. The service onboard was wonderful! All the crew were very friendly, helpful and genuine. The flight time was only 7.5hrs and I loved how the crew managed to finish a full dinner service in an hour and ten minutes while still being polite and not cutting corners. Would completely recommend."
450,Not Verified |  Second time in just a few months that I'm delayed overnight due to late flights and missed connections. So now I'm waiting in line again for a new flight and a voucher to a poor hotel. I'm really surprised at the nonchalant attitude the airline seems to have about making flight times and connections. All of my flights this year have been delayed. I'm never taking this airline again
451,"Not Verified |  I recommend taking another airline. If you have the option this is the worst airline I’ve taken. My flight home was supposed to be four hours and ended up turning into a nightmare and lasting me 24 hours to get home. My flight kept delaying and was eventually canceled calling customer service was a mess as they were rude and not helpful at all. Plus I’ve never had any issues flying till I’ve taken American Airlines which is my first and last time, I never write reviews but I wanted to make sure people do not go through the same thing as I went through. Traveling alone is supposed to be smooth, but ended up traumatizing me. I definitely won’t be flying with American Airlines again."
452,"Not Verified |  I'm flying on average 12-15 times a year with different domestic and international airlines but never had such horrible experience like I had lately with American Airlines. They are liars and hypocrites cause they say different things over the phone and totally different in person, were they want me to pay $100 extra for the checked box containing only full size 29"" bicycle which weighted 51.7 Lbs. then forced me to ripped everything apart in the middle of the airport and remove pedals, seat, calipers and brake pads so it's weight was within 50 Lbs. Staff at the gate was horrible threatening to charge me another $100 for my carry-on which had to had all the extra parts I was forced to remove from checked box placed in it. On my way back, flight from DFW to DEN was delayed over 4 hours and 3 different gate changes but there was not even a single word of apology. "
453,"Not Verified |  Initially the plane was suppose to board at 6:20 am, so we began our journey yesterday morning at 2:30 am. After getting ready and traveling to the airport we receive a notification that the flight has been pushed pack until 10 am which is fine, we decided we would just sleep in the rental for 3 hrs, we have an infant that is traveling with us and we thought it would be best to let him sleep. Then we get notified that the flight has been pushed back to 11 which would cause us to miss our connecting flight. Customer service sucked balls, offering a different flight for $150 a person or the other option would be we could travel for 27 hrs in total vs the 11 hr one initially booked. So we had to stay an additional day, pay the additional fees, hotel fees and the return flight tomorrow still will be ridiculous."
454,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew to PVD via DCA. No delay on outbound flight. Flight was very smooth as pilots avoided bad weather over the Appalachians and took a southerly route via ATL before turning north. The result - very little turbulence encountered. On arrival in DCA I had a short connection but made the flight with 10 minutes to spare. The gate agents were aware of incoming flights having minor delays. I love 737-800s back seat device holders that hold both iPhones and iPads. The ICE worked flawlessly on the 737-800. The 2nd leg from DCA-PVD was on a Mitsubishi CRJ 700. The WiFi on this flight did not work as well as on the 737-800. Kudos to American Airlines flight crew. They were polite and friendly. Service is typical (biscotti, snack and soft drinks) of all domestic flights."
455,"Not Verified | Absolutely THE WORST airline. The bathrooms on the plane were filthy and not cleaned by flight attendants prior to passengers boarding the plane. There was faeces smeared all over one bathroom and the other had some kind of seeds or sand that broke all over it. There was no first aid kit on the plane. My finger got injured and was beeding. I was only given 2 bandaids and was told to wash it out with water from the dirty bathroom. The flight attendants forgot I was washing my finger and blocked the bathroom doors, I almost did not make it to my seat prior to take off, this shows how careless the flight crew was. The flight attendants did not properly do their jobs, they allowed the passengers to store small handbags and mini backpacks in the overhead compartment and also stored their own luggage, which occupied all the space and half of the passengers had to have their carry on luggage checked. My genuine leather, expensive bag got ruined and they refused to cover the cost. The service on the plane was horrible and there were no TV screens. I will never fly this airline again!"
456,"Not Verified |  Infuriation experience! My family of 5 arrived at the Knoxville airport at approximately 4;00 am for our 6;00 am flight. We arrived to see a massive crowd of what looked like students checking in with large crates for each student to check in. After standing in line for approximately 45 minutes with no movement in the line at all, I walked up to 1st class and asked if they could help us get checked in. We told the 1st lady that we had been trying to check in through the kiosk but 2 of the 3 were malfunctioning (the staff knew about it). She told me I would need to get back in line. When I went to the front of the line for the 2nd time to tell them we needed to get checked in for our flight, we were told there was no way we were going to make our flight. I begged them to get us on the flight. I told them there were 5 of us traveling together, their kiosks were broken, and we were there in plenty of time but they were not about to help us. I was told by 4 separate AA employees that this is what they do every single day because they are so short staffed. I told them it was my son's 16th birthday and we had a surprise party gathering at our home that evening but they could have cared less. I pled with them and they didn't even pretend to care. I asked them to look at the security cameras to see how early we arrived but they wouldn't do a thing to help us. I ended up having to rent another car and 2 hotel rooms because of AA's complete lack of customer concern or ability to do their job adequately because of their lack of staff. I am beyond disappointed and have thought about this every day since this event."
457,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the most horrible airline I’ve ever flown with. I used to fly with them all the time I will never fly with them again, the only good thing was the ticket agent in Phoenix helped me out. Everybody else was rude, the ticket agent in Dallas Fort Worth was absolutely rude. We booked a flight my husband and I for vacation and they booked us in separate areas of the plane. I mean he’s in the very front and I’m in the very back. When I tried to address it they told me I had to pay them more money. That’s absolutely ridiculous that I have to pay more money to sit by my husband on a plane flight that we booked together."
458,"Not Verified |  Terrible customer service in terms of rescheduling, you pay and pay and pay for reschedule, but then when your flights are delayed you get none of your money back. Chaotic flight times."
459,"✅ Trip Verified | First off, I was the one who made the initial mistake of picking the day before my son's big event. I admitted that. I needed the flight to be the next day or so. But this was my first time purchasing or flying with American and I went through the checkout process I guess I picked something called ""Basic"" which they explained ""basically"" means you are out of luck if you need any kind of assistance, customer service, and definitely any changes. After speaking with a chat agent that is what we finally established. They CAN make changes, they are just UNWILLING if you make a mistake like I did (and even willing to pay a fee btw). You know... The customer! The chat is below. The agent, their employee, agreed their policy is ridiculous. Now, some of you may say, ""Well, that's just their policy so sorry about your luck""! And I would say, ""You are absolutely correct, 'By-the-book-Bobby'""! But I'm sorry, if that is a company's stance on helping a customer I will just find a new company moving forward and share my experience, hopefully warn potential victims of theirs moving forward, and share my dissatisfaction! My disgust! We are not valued as customers to these airlines. We've all known that for a very long time. American Airlines, I will never fly with you again, just out of principal."
460,"Not Verified |  Airline has zero personal responsibility. We were late for our first flight, fine, our fault. They put us on standby, which did not work. We ended up paying for another flight to our destination. They had, unbeknownst to us, canceled our return flight. We found this out the morning we had to leave. Once again, we had to purchase new tickets on the fly. Now, here we are with unable to put in for a request, not a for sure, for a refund on at least our return flights, which you know they filled, because we never got a ticket. Several thousand out. Terrible company. We will never use again."
461,"Not Verified |  On Thursday, October 12, 2023, I had a flight with a connection from Tampa through Charlotte to Indy.  The plane was late to Tampa and sat on tarmac for a while before finally taking off and then I still missed my connection to Indy from Charlotte because I was not able to run to make the connection. Then we were told to wait at customer service.  I made the gate before departure time by the way.  At customer service there was one agent who then decided to leave for her lunch, and we were told that another agent would be there in 5 minutes!  Leaving no one at the counter. There were at least 20 people in line from all over the country who had missed their connections.  Shortly thereafter there were 4 agents. My question is:  How many corporate people have had to stay overnight in an airport that is under construction, by yourself so you are not really comfortable falling asleep with no one else to help watch your things, or just falling asleep as a female on her own, where all the stores and restaurants are closed.  Mind you, the flight had already been changed from getting into Indy at 9:30 at night to 12:13 am. I am a teacher and was trying to get a couple days to relax before going back to school.  This was everything but relaxing and very frustrating and unfortunately American Airlines has lost 3 customers because of this treatment and disregard for what people are going through.  I didn’t have anywhere to be necessarily but I heard others were trying to get to a funeral, a wedding, a surgery.  You never know what is going on in someone’s life.  I was told we were not able to get hotels or food vouchers because of way the flight was coded as “air traffic” which is still not my fault.  I just don’t understand what is going on with the airlines and their level of customer care and dependability!  Yes, I was put on another flight but what about my time I had to spend in the airport with no food or comfortable, safe place to rest?"
462,"Not Verified |  The flight attendants are the rudest and most unprofessional of all. I have flown all different airlines, but out of all, American Airlines is the worst. One flight attendant spilled leftover food on me but did not even apologize. Instead, she handed me paper towels and demanded me to pick up the ones on the floor. I asked if I could have a pen to fill out customs form and another flight attendant said, ""Do we look like we carry extra pens? We don't."" I also saw an Asian grandmother getting asked, ""Do you understand or speak English?"" with the rudest tone. What kind of diverse ""American"" Airlines is this? I will never use this airline again."
463,"✅ Trip Verified | On Oct 17 Tuesday, I was supposed to take the 7:05 am flight from JFK to CUN, DIRECT FLIGHT. The ground staff from American Airlines told me my original flight AA1327 was delayed and time changed to 12 pm. I got there in the counter around 4 am without sleeping. I did not receive any notification nor email, he said he just knew it, so he offered me to fly to Charlotte to transit for my destination in Cancun arrives around 11:30am I did not want to wait for the 12pm flight so I accepted it. But I discovered my original flight-AA1327 was on schedule. I am hugely disappointed to American Airlines, as if this is a custom that the company usually does, just because I did not purchase premium tickets? Or the reason of overbooking passengers? What I only care and mind is, it gave me a big hassle taking off and taking on another flight. What's more I trusted the information from their staff and I lost the trust in this company COMPLETELY and I would avoid flying with AA, because there's no integrity, the staff did not disclosure the right information for me to make such decision and it's intentional lying. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE"
464,Not Verified |  Late coming to Tulsa and returning from Tulsa. Missed both connecting flights due the airplane being late. Had to take flights 3hours later. The most horrible airline ever. I will never  fly this airline again.
465,✅ Trip Verified |   Customer service is really bad! Takes 40 to 45 minutes to talk to the agent. Incredibly hard to receive refund. No phone to contact a refund team. Not gonna use this airline again.
466,"✅ Trip Verified |   I wish to give an excellent review to one of your employees who checked us in at bag check in Sarasota Florida. Her name is Michelle. Our experience with checking a bag was exceptional from beginning to end. I was traveling with my 13 year old daughter, and she made her feel at ease with kindness and humor. In fact, I told her in all my years of traveling (I’m in my 60’s), I have never encountered an attendant who was so great in her demeanor as a professional airline employee. I hope this can somehow reach her from your end. In this day with all the trouble in travel, I found this so refreshing and needed to reach out to both her and you."
467,"✅ Trip Verified |   Would give zero if I could. By far the worst baggage experience of my life. They took 15 minutes to get a manager out and my toddler got impatient, started messing around and fell hard. Traveling as a military family is always stressful, but on our way out on American Airlines, the baggage attendant did not make a big deal, just checked all our bags, even the overweight ones and sent us on our way in 5 minutes. The baggage personnel have in DC kept us waiting and then charged us $200 anyway. Managers can waive fees. The choice was help us out or screw us over and they chose the latter. I have never had worse service from airline personnel and will never fly American Airlines again."
468,"Not Verified |  This is the worst airline I have dealt with. 4 times in a row they have overbooked, canceled flights, or just not let certain people on. The first time the over booked the flight and made us miss a funeral, the second time they canceled the flight making us miss a cremation ceremony, this last time they only let half of the people on the plane making us miss our sons bootcamp graduation .... oddly enough the only people denied a seat were those going to the graduation. This last time was so bad we had to sleep in DFW overnight and they had to put us on a delta flight instead then canceled the return ticket while making us pay an extra $275 for a new flight. The staff was rude and disrespectful with one staff passively challenging my wife to fight him."
469,"Not Verified |  Worst customer service ever. Just tried to pay for an upgrade to first class. My traveling partner did it using the app with no problem. I logged on and the app could not find my reservation. I used the chatbot. Total disaster. I called customer service and was told to use the app. Then I was transfered to web help. That person said she could not help me. I asked for someone who could and she said that's not how it works and to use the app. When I said this was terrible customer service she said use the app. So if you can fly any other airline please, please do yourself a favor and do."
470,✅ Trip Verified |   American Airlines is the worst. They had issues while we were on the plane & had us wait 1 hour & 30mins while they figure out what’s wrong it so we can pull off. I made it to Dallas just on time for my 2nd flight to Houston - at least that’s what I thought and they closed the flight 15 minutes early. So I had to wait til 6:00pm for another flight. In between that I tried to talk to a supervisor on who was very unprofessional. I asked to talk to someone higher than him due to his attitude. He was waving us away as if we aren’t paying customers he specifically told me I’m not getting anyone higher than him. I can’t believe we are being treated like this. Never again.
471,"Not Verified |  They made traveling with children very stressful. We were the last group to board, they never called for families with car seats or children to board first. While boarding both flights, I felt like we were bumping everyone with our car seats and struggled installing the car seats. Our flight out of Philly was smooth, however our flight out of Pensacola was not. The woman working the counter gave me a hard time about the diaper bag, which per their policy online does not count as a carry on. She kept telling me I had 1 too many bags. I argued saying I don’t understand their policy states it does not count as a carry on, and I had zero problems when I flew out from Philly. She finally told me to just go. Then once we were boarded, there was maintenance needed on the wing, which delayed us an hour. I know this is of nobody’s fault, but since boarding was such a hassle I already was upset and was so nervous we’d have to unload the children. Thankfully we didn’t have to. After my experience, I am going to try to avoid flying American Airlines if I have the option."
472,✅ Trip Verified |  The Wi-Fi is so poor on the plane. It doesn't let you know that your flight has been delayed until you get down in. You can turn your phone on to find out that hey your place delayed by 7 hours and then with the Wi-Fi you can try and book another flight but it's probably not going to happen as it just spins around and spins around because there's no good Wi-Fi in the airport at all. This is in Philadelphia. There's hardly any place like your phone in as well and this isn't the c terminal which is also not in numerical order. Then they offer me a couple different flights back to Boston but one of them was going to Providence which is not really anywhere near. I live and like I would have to drive 2 hours home from there. Then they give me another updated flight that I could get on and then I am trying to sign into it. But the Wi-Fi is not good so couldn't get that flight and by the time I could it said that it was filled. I'm not getting any kind of anything back from them. They're not a good airline. There's no people that are at the gates. Apparently everybody works for only fans right now and you know that's it. There is no customer service.
473,"Not Verified |  Coming back from Greece after a 4 hour trip to London and a 7 plus hour trip from London to JFK I was scheduled to take a 12:59 PM flight to Pittsburgh, PA. After delaying the flight a couple times, we loaded and departed the gate and sat on the runway for over 2 1/2 hours before bring us back to the gate and leaving the plane. We kept getting delays until they finally cancelled the flight at 7:20 PM. I approached an American Airlines employee and asked her for a hotel voucher. She accused me of ""coming at her"". I tried unsuccessfully to get a rental car and there was no help anywhere to find a room close by. My son and daughter in law finally found me a room at a less than desirable hotel at $542/night. I had a friend of mine drive all the way to Brooklyn on Sunday morning and drive me home. I expressed all this in a complaint to American Airlines and gave them receipts. After 2 weeks they finally got back to me and told me they they referred the complaint to British Airways with whom I made the reservations to Greece and back. The bottom line here is that American Airlines staff were rude as hell and I couldn't find anyone there who could care less. I will never fly AA again. This is without a doubt the worst airlines in the business."
474,"✅ Trip Verified |  American airlines is rude and will always be my last choice for an airline. First of all, our mobile tickets said a completely different gate in the C gates, and 20 minutes before take off we noticed that and so we made it to B gates with 10 minutes left before departure. My wife needed pads so I was gonna walk into the store right next to the gate and they basically started yelling at us saying that we're late and they're leaving without us etc etc. Well we would've been perfectly on time if your app worked correctly. When we get on board luckily the flight attendant got us some pads but then she isn't allowed to go into the bathroom for 30 seconds to put it on, even though it took another 20 minutes to take off. Not to mention my last flight with them was before I was 18 and when a connection flight got cancelled they wouldn't help me with a hotel or anywhere to sleep, and simply said ""see if you have any family around here"" while I'm thousands of miles away from any family. So they made me sleep in the general lobby alone while everyone else got hotel vouchers. Terrible airline the only thing they have going for them is the prices. There's a reason it's so cheap."
475,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst flight ever. Save your money and fly with another aircraft. How would you like to fly with you 3 kids of one is a baby and you get into Miami at 5, your next flight departing at 7pm but they delay your flight and you don’t fly out until 12:00am and when you call to get some compensation the give you 7,500 points which is equivalent to $75.00 for a 1,059 flight. No meal ticket and no option to rebook because the next flight only have 2 seats available. So you are stuck sitting at the airport with a crying baby and 2 tired kids. Never again!"
476,"✅ Trip Verified |  A frustrating trip all around. Late flights causing stressful connections, overbooked flights, etc. Very stressful. The dog situation on 2 of our four planes was very uncomfortable. Our flight from Atlanta to Toronto had a dog on it that barked the entire flight. It was awful. Our flight from Toronto to Washington on our way home had a large dog on a passengers lap, almost directly behind our Business class seats, that was close enough and large enough that it caused my wife (who has a fear of dogs) to be very uncomfortable. We were under the impression that pet dogs on flights had to be in carriers? We will not be recommending AA at all."
477,"✅ Trip Verified |  
We were supposed to have a flight from Indianapolis to Miami and from Miami to Punta Cana on 10/01. Our flight in Indianapolis was supposed to board at 5:38AM, so we woke up at 2:45 in the morning to get to the airport by 4:00AM. Around 4:30 our flight got delayed to 10:00AM, causing us to miss our connecting flight to Punta Cana. Originally we didn’t think this would be a big deal, we figured American Airlines would just change our connecting flight to a later one. Well, we were wrong. The soonest they claimed they could get us to Punta Cana was 6:00PM the NEXT day. For no particular reason other than there was no room in other connecting flights for the rest of the day. This was incredibly frustrating for several reasons. First of all, we woke up at 2:45 in the morning to get to the airport and they didn’t let us know our flight was delayed until last minute. After looking at the previous flights, they knew it was going to be delayed for a while and failed to tell anyone. The second reason being that they made no accommodations whatsoever to get us to our destination in a reasonable amount of time. The third reason being that we have had this trip planned for over a year, it is our honeymoon, and now we are losing 40 hours out of our only 4 day vacation. This is the first time either of us have flown with American Airlines and it will be our last. They 100% ruined our honeymoon and made it the most stressful trip we’ve ever been on, when it was supposed to be the most relaxing. They offered for us to stay in a hotel in Miami, which we accepted. However, the hotel is less than desirable and quite frankly looks embarrassing and gross. They didn’t offer any other accommodations such as food, quicker flights, or some sort of refund. We will be losing money on our all inclusive resort that we paid for. We tried to change the day we leave our honeymoon after we found out about this delay to have more time on vacation, but there were limited options available through American Airlines and now there’s the concern that our flight home will get delayed as well. Normally I’m an easygoing person but this has been an absolutely horrible experience, a ruined honeymoon, and money lost. We worked so hard to be able to afford this vacation, to have the time off for work, and we haven’t been on a vacation together before. We wanted this honeymoon to he special at an all inclusive resort where we can enjoy each other and our experience. We won’t be able to go on another vacation like this for a very long time. We needed this time off for ourselves but this was not a vacation at all. It was just stressful. After reading other reviews I see how awful American Airlines has been to other customers as well. We will never use them again. "
478,"✅ Trip Verified | Airplane was in disrepair, 2-3 delays, borrowed manoeuvring engine (3) 2 or 3 gate changes, verbalized shortness of staff several times, cabin door seal was leaking creating a loud sound. Captain and stewards were great though. Terrible airline, first time flying with them and last."
479,"✅ Trip Verified | On September 26, 2023. I was flying out from Austin to Indianapolis. This was a round trip ticket. I had my 17 lbs 2-year-old miniature poodle with me. I have used the same pet carrier for a number of years, and this will probably be my fourth flying with my dog on American Airlines. Within the last 2 years. The American Airline agent, told me that my dog carrier was too large, and he was not going to check him in. I told him that this was a round trip ticket on the same airline and we had no issues flying out from Indianapolis. Instead of listening, he stopped looking at me and stated that he was not going to check the dog as he walked away to get his supervisor. The supervisor came back with a measuring tape and told me that it was too large. She then asked me to tell my dog on command to turn around in the carrier. I explained to her that I cannot make my dog turn around in the pet carrier on common. They then stated that my dog needed to be under 16 lbs to fly. This also isn’t the policy on their website, the dog needs to be under 20 lbs. I had to say, “will you please listen to me. I flew round trip on American, this was not an issue. I again, explained to both of them that this is not my first time flying with my dog, and that I am a physician and I need to get back so I could go to work tomorrow.” The supervisor then asked me for my record locator. By this time, another supervisor was on the phone with the 1st supervisor and stated that they can allow for me to take my dog. The supervisor then told me that I got lucky this time and to buy another carrier. She then stated to me they have different protocols at other airports but in Austin they follow the rules. I said to her that you are telling me that the AA ticket agents in Philadelphia, Kentucky, both Chicago airports and Indianapolis were all wrong, but the two of you were the only ones who were correct? He proceeds to tell me stories of dogs in baby carriages that he had to turn away. I told him, that I do not have a pet baby carriage, I have a carrier that I have used repeatedly without an issue until today. He handed me my ticket and I left. American Airline carrier requires: 18x11x11 (length +width+ height) My pet carrier 16.1 x 11.8 x 14 I fly frequently with my miniature poodle. I have the AMEX platinum card and I listed American Airlines as my carrier in order to receive points and I truly regret this decision, since I cannot change my carrier for another year. There is truly no such thing as customer service when it comes to these Airlines. American is no better then any of the others."
480,"Not Verified |  Terrible experience. 3/4 of my American flights were delayed causing me to almost miss connections. The biggest kick was last leg home DFW to ANC, plane had no hot water in forward galley, that's not a reason to refuse a plane since 99% of water used comes out of a plastic bottle. You want hot water you've got a microwave to make that happen. So that delayed us, 3 hours had to swap gates and planes - very frustrating. It was a $500 price difference between Delta and American for my trip. I'll be paying the extra next time for sure! You can't put a price on the extra stress added by late flights and added stress trying to get where you're going on a supposed to be relaxing vacation!"
481,"Not Verified |  My flight from Washington DC to Boston was delayed 7 hours! After I texted customer service I was mad and asked why the flight was delayed for 7 hours and 45 minutes. She told me goodbye without any reasonable response! Then I called and the lady on the phone was very unprofessional, she was saying yes your flight is delayed and this is not my mistake you can go to another company if you would like! and that said, the airplane still has some technical issues! I mean for 7 and 45 minutes delayed because the airplane was broken. This is not acceptable. I am done with American Airlines. this will be the last trip for me with American Airlines. Customer service is zero. Air services are zero."
482,"✅ Trip Verified |  I just wanted to share a terrible experience I had so folks are informed about American Airlines fraudulent guarantee for family seating together at no extra cost. I took a flight to yesterday Sept 22 NY to Delhi with my two children who are 3 and 7 (AA292) at 8:55 pm. When I had booked the flight it was just me and to my two children yet when they issued my boarding, pass AA booked me in three different seats in three different rows. When I argued about it with the manager at the gate she was extremely rude to me and she asked me if I had paid for my seats, otherwise they wouldn’t be able to help me. This is despite AA’s claim on CNN and USA Today that AA will seat families together for no extra cost. When I asked her about the rights of families to be seated together, and the guarantee that had been made the manager asked me how about the rights of the other passengers who paid for their seat? Why should you as a family with small children get a priority ? She then told me go inside and discuss it with the passengers feigning complete lack of empathy. Of course, when I went in, the passengers refused to switch their seat because they said they paid extra for it. When I spoke to the air hostess, she said that this happened on a weekly basis, and that people were not willing to give up their seats. For this flight American Airlines was selling individual aisle seats for a higher price, after families had booked on basic economy, even after they knew that families needed the seats to be together, and when families came in all the aisle seats were taken, and so they were all separated. At the time of reservation even though the seats had been available, the families were not seated together automatically even under the same reservation. This violates the guarantee on their website. The truth is American Airlines is not family friendly and it seems they need customer service training and child focused training if they want to become a family friendly airline. Currently the PR and their actual service are mis-matched as the managers didn’t seem to know about the guarantees the company make online, neither did the air crew it seems. Eventually I had to beg and pay people myself to get them to let me sit with my kids. It was extremely nerve-racking. All this while on my children were crying with no real support from the air hostess. We need solid legislation to enforce airlines to meet the statements they make. If they can’t seat family together and see there are two small children and a parent traveling on a flight they need to inform the passenger at the moment of booking that the seats will not be together. They should not try to sell the seats to individual passengers and then at a later point tell families there is no seating or that they need to pay extra, leaving them at the discretion of other passengers. AA is prioritizing profit over families."
483,"Not Verified | We have had the most disappointing experience. This caused us to lose an entire day and we paid for excursions that couldn’t be refunded. My Mom, sister, and I were going on the trip of lifetime to Barcelona. We boarded the plane in Philadelphia and sat on it for two hours before we had to get off after two hours. We were told there was multiple failures. How were we even able to board? We got off the plane with no instructions. We were supposed to get our meal/dinner on the plane and they gave us a $12 meal voucher so we could get a bag of Cheetos in the airport - LOL! At that time most of the restaurants were not serving food any longer. They provided us with a hotel and shuttle service. The hotel left much to be desired and we ended up getting an Uber because the line was so long to get a shuttle. We also found out that a flight to Paris was also cancelled. The next day we came back we sat in an area and left our travel pillows and a set of crutches in a back seating area. We grabbed lunch and came back to the area with a flight attendant sitting there. She said those were her pillows and we couldn’t sit there. We asked why and she said it was for crew. I asked why we couldn’t sit there because there was no signage for indicating we couldn’t sit there. She asked if I knew I was talking to and I said are you an employee. She said yes and I asked her name. She threatened to call security. Mind you I am in a wheelchair. I told her go for it! I can’t go anywhere fast. She eventually left the area and everyone around us thought she was totally inappropriate. I will definitely consider this experience as we consider flying in the future."
484,Not Verified |  I asked AA to change my flight or provide a credit for an honest mistake in my purchase. I accidentally picked the wrong cities to leave and go to backwards. They refused to give a credit or help me change it unless I paid an additional $500 dollars for one way! I will never fly AA again. My return flight was through United and they immediately cancelled the flight and gave me a future credit. No one could do anything nor did they care that I was out money and the flight is wasted.
485,"Not Verified |  I booked tickets to have the airline change them 5 times, not me to then only leave a small window to get to my connecting flight! Then there was delays from the get go, to then being at a standstill in theO Hare to get to our gate! We had our connecting flight to Alabama a few gates down. I ran to our gate but had my husband wait for my check bag! We were traveling with friends they got on the plane, but when the attendant called the pilot stating we were delayed and four of us were traveling the Pilot refused to wait for us! As we got our bag the flight was then closed as we sat there and the plane was still there and could not get on, we ended up having to fly to DC then to Alabama a total of 8 hours more to get to our destination. It was a nightmare, and I will never fly this airline again. We had a full day of vacation that we could not enjoy due to this experience. The attendant was not nice at all at O Hare, I will again never fly with this airline."
486,✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines is the worst. I am a loyalty member and I regret it completely. This is the second time this year my flight was delayed and I missed my connecting flight. I have wasted a lot of money and time on American Airlines. I do not recommend anyone to use AA.com. I had to stay over night in a strange city with my kids. I huge hassle. I received vouchers that were not excepted because all restaurants are closed so they are completely useless. I am canceling my loyalty membership immediately.
487,✅ Trip Verified |  Had planned a trip to Madison for by niece’s wedding. We’re packed and ready to go to bed and our trip was cancelled and rescheduled at 11pm. We originally had a 6:00 am flight arriving at 10:30am to our destination. We were rescheduled to leave at 2:30 pm via DFW with a 5 hour layover arriving at our destination at 11pm. Horrible option. Cancelled trip. Will never fly AA again. Had to wait on hold for hours to try and reschedule.
488,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have encountered an awful incident & demeaning interaction with an AA staff assigned to do the boarding process. Before they started calling the group number assigned to board the plane. Before boarding time, we were already standing behind the wall that was out of the way from the line to wait for our group number to be called. While I was standing with my sister, we witnessed the agent display unprofessional behaviors towards other passengers specifically to the girl/teen in his age group. He was suspicious but flirting at the same time, & asking her if she was the one in the passport, but then let her go and let her board the plane anyways without calling the security check. Another incident, he let the a person board, even though it was not his turn to board yet, his number was the same as ours, and AA staff said, ""Are you alone? but, I will let you go, even if it's not your turn to board yet, just this time.” After a few more mins, the agent had stopped calling the group number & instead, he had started just saying, next, to let the other passengers board without calling the sequence number. So, I finally approached him, what number he was calling, he then screamed at me and told us to go to the “cue” which we did & followed him, but first, I had told him to “cool it down” & no need to scream at us, it’s unnecessary. We then proceeded to the wall behind us and went to the passenger line, where he said the ”cue” as exactly what he just told us to do. I saw him smirking, laughing with another passenger, and telling her about us. At the same time, I had overheard the agent calling the security to do a luggage check on us for no apparent reason.  I totally understood clearly that a random check could happen at any time to anyone to check luggage again if they are under any suspicion. But the agent acted more like a scornful staff & retaliated further to show his power.  We didn’t leave the airport, we were just there for transfers & we are just there for boarding. Even the supervisor told me he was not supposed to do that without letting him know first. He clearly violated AA protocol per his supervisor. "
489,"✅ Trip Verified | An all-time new low from American Airlines domestic. How dare they get away with calling this joke of a service First Class? Of course First Class was packed with all the AAdvantage upgrades. In reality, the ONLY thing you get in American domestic First Class is a slightly wider seat. The service from the stewardess was non-existent. She did the bare minimum and then disappeared into the galley for the entire flight. I would not have believed earlier reviews about the new B737-800 MAX if I hadn't experienced it myself for the first time. The seats, even in First Class, are extraordinarily uncomfortable, even for a mere four hour flight. Also, there is no seat-back entertainment screen whatsoever. Presumably, this is some ploy to force passengers to pay for the very poor WIFI. I cannot stress enough how awful American Airlines truly is. Do not waste your hard earned money or points flying this airlines, unless you absolutely are forced to do so. "
490,"✅ Trip Verified | I was initially booked First Class on British Airways, but downgraded by BA to Business Class on Air Belgium. I did not wish to fly on British Airways charter to Chicago, so elected to fly on American Airlines who only have Business Class to ORD from LHR. I have not flown on American Airlines for some years, and hoped for a dramatic service improvement in Business Class trans-Atlantic. Sadly, the service on American Airlines is much worse. The cabin crew were surly, and inattentive. The food was literally inedible, and the wine selection a bad joke. The flight attendant almost threw the food at the passengers, with no smile whatsoever, and then disappeared for the majority of the flight. Absolutely atrocious service, and American Airlines should be ashamed."
491,✅ Trip Verified | Why is it every time I fly with American the service in some way is always screwed up. Great flight today from CLT to Seattle and I’m have been on the tarmac for 30 minutes waiting on a gate! What the hell is wrong with you people? At least try and get it right once in awhile!
492,"Not Verified |  I have flown many airlines and refuse to fly American again. The attendants are rude, they are slow and not responsive to issues. They refused my son and I boarding in Dallas and we missed our connection in Japan and they cancelled our return flights and rebooked a much longer flight and refused to reimburse."
493,"✅ Trip Verified | I requested assistance when I landed in Charlotte. No assistance was given, when I asked the gate agent, mentioning I was disabled and my connect was several concourses away, her reply, 'well just do the best you can.' Then I arrived at my connection gate, E17, the gate assistant told me, 'so what? She was encouraging you.' WHAT? Total lack of professionalism. American Airlines SUCKS!"
494,"Not Verified |  My flight was on September 10th from Rochester to Philadelphia then to Doha, Kathmandu through Qatar Airways. My flight got cancelled & they rebooked the ticket so I was ok thinking it happens. Next day I was suppose to fly Boston then Diana Kathmandu. I was at the Rochester airport from 3pm till 9.30, still couldn’t fly. My flight from Boston to Doha was at 10.25. After 9, no use of flying because airlines don’t provide the hotel. I tried to rebook through counter person at the airport, but they were very rude and unhelpful. I will not travel American Airlines again. They don’t know how to handle the customer."
495,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst airline experience i’ve ever had. Every single time I or anyone I know has flown it’s been delayed, cancelled or there have been other issues in which they do not provide compensation for the inconveniences they cause. Every single time. I don’t know how they are still a running airline. It’s a trash airline. If you have important places to be, I recommend any other airline, even Spirit over American."
496,"Not Verified |  Connection flight was cancelled. Instead I got two extra flights. One of which was delayed, and the other was postponed by two days. Two nights at the hotel were unpaid and no food was provided."
497,"Not Verified |  American Airlines is absolute garbage. The last two trips I have taken I used American Airlines and both times they canceled one of my connecting flights, leaving me stranded halfway home. They do almost nothing to help you rebook. The help line just doesn’t pick up the phone. 50 people have to get in line to speak to one representative at the desk. It’s a nightmare every time. 0/10 don’t recommend."
498,"Not Verified |  We had a delay in Jamaica due to a storm in Philadelphia. When we arrived in Philadelphia trying to connect to our Pittsburgh flight, we arrived 3 minutes late to the gate and the boarding had closed. The woman called to see if we could enter and we were denied access. With a family member in a wheelchair, we had to travel through the airport to customer service to get booked on another flight and they were going to separate us and give us seats on the back of the plane (who does that to a person in a wheelchair?). The woman at customer service did get us better seating. Additionally, the airline makes too many assumptions, the airline seems to be more accommodating to their staff vs. to their customers."
499,"Not Verified | I have no words for American. Every time I have flown with them in the last two years I have had a delay or cancellation and with a toddler usually in tow. They don’t do anything to help they all seem unhappy and it has been such a disappointment. When I flew to Texas with them the same thing happened but we had to sleep in the airport because they just kept rescheduling. On this current flight it’s always waiting for a flight attendant. There's no compensation, no thanks for your patience. It’s ridiculous and I will not be flying them again!"
500,"✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines: Absolute disrespect and disregard for their customers. I flew American Airlines from Boise to Phoenix. We left late. The flight attendant said they were waiting for 2 people. Once the 2 people showed up we didn't leave. The pilot stated on the intercom that the flight was overbooked and they were waiting for 4 people to argue it out for the 1 empty seat. Once the final person was on, we left. Again, we were now late leaving Boise. We were scheduled to leave at 1:48 and the doors closed at 2:04, left about 5 minutes later. We were scheduled to arrive at 2:54 arrived at 2:58, so the pilot made up much of the time. We got to the gate at 3:03. I was off the plane by 3:11. I ran from gate A2 to gate A22. It's a much larger trek than it seems since it's a different arm of the terminal. I'm 65 and have COPD so this run was very difficult, but I am still pretty fast. I heard my name over the intercom as I ran so I just kept running. By the time I got to the gate, I was breathless and couldn't speak. The door to the tarmac was closed, but they opened it and I ran 3/4 down the tarmac before they shut the door to the plane. I collapsed on the tarmac out of breath from the run. My flight was scheduled to leave Phoenix at 3:22 and it left at 3:17. So they not only didn't they wait for me to make the connection, they left early. They could wait for people in Boise and make us all late, but left 5 minutes early and couldn't wait 1 second for me in Phoenix. What absolute disrespect and disregard for their customers."
501,"✅ Trip Verified | Multiple flights were delayed due to weather and eventually cancelled due to staffing shortages - which is a SERVICE FAILURE by American Airlines. We had to book a hotel and rent a car to travel home more than 10 hours to get home to our young daughter where we also had to adjust child care. When we spoke to a customer service representative about some sort of reimbursement for our more than $500 of unplanned travel expenses and explain our situation, we were met with a cold, unhelpful, patronizing, and dismissive person who clearly had a script and was not willing to help us out at all. I was surprised that a service industry professional would be so unwilling to provide us with some sort of retribution for our troubles that we clearly outlined as more involved than a simple weather cancellation. If this is not resolved in an equitable manner then I will never fly American Airlines again and vehemently recommend no one else fly this airline as well."
502,"✅ Trip Verified |  On 09/09/2023, I had a ticket Flight from Miami (MIA Airport) to New York City (LGA), number 1389 departuring at 08:40 PM. However the flight got cancelled with no reason or explanation. After several attempts to contact the American Airlines Customer Services by phone, after waiting for more than 30 minutes the calls got hung up on me, the chat on line service kept saying the same answer over and over, that they could not help because they were limited and there was no flights available until two days after. Finally, after 3 hours on a huge line at the airport customer service, they put me on a waiting list for the following day, with no guarantee that I can fly and should spend the whole day at the airport trying. On top of that, my luggage was sent to La Guardia/ NYC, so they didn't provide accommodation in any hotel, I didn't have my clothes with me, and had the worst experience ever. They said the flight got canceled due to issues with the weather which is not true, because both the weather in Miami and New York were perfect fine. There's no respect or empathy with their customers."
503,✅ Trip Verified |  This is the second time that I've had to spend the night of the airport. Last time we were here for nearly two days because of American. They put us on a plane and had no AC they left us in there for a couple of hours got us back out made us wait a couple hours. Then put us back on the plane again it kept shutting off and they finally said oh never mind we're canceling the flight fully after torturing us for 5 or 6 hours. It was not weather related. No hotel vouchers no vouchers of any kind. Customer service number just says we're busy and hangs up. It's been another couple of hours in line to talk to somebody. He said there's nothing I can do sorry. Something terrible always happens with this airline. Don't ever use them.
504,"✅ Trip Verified | Flying used to be my favorite method of travel, but the airlines have been terrible as of late and American Airlines has been the worst. I have had to fly using American several times this year and not a single time has a flight not been cancelled or delayed. This most recent trip has been the worst experience yet as they cancelled my connecting flight during mid-flight, rebooked me for a flight that boarded in 15 minutes after landing that was also on the opposite side of the airport, and then promptly delayed the flight, and they also added a stop to my travel that had a layover of 6 hours. I am fine using American Airlines and will be driving for my travels as much as possible as the airlines can't be trusted to be reliable."
505,Not Verified | I paid extra for window seat since I’m claustrophobic. They gave me a seat next to a wall. I had a panic attack and they wouldn’t even bring me water. The flight attendant made me wait until she had her cart up front to start serving water. The absolute worst airline I’ve ever flown.
506,"Not Verified | The flight was delayed multiple times, and in the end, the flight was diverted to JFK. Gate personnel are rude and unprofessional. Gladly changed the flight to the following day but seats that were reserved on the original flight were not available and the airline tried to charge me extra for them when seats where available."
507,Not Verified | I was booked on a flight because Delta had major issues. They booked me on a delayed flight with American. This particular flight would make me miss my connecting flight. Staff were so helpful - literally saved the day and provided top tier customer service!
508,"Not Verified |  As a German Tourist I will not Book or Fly with American Airlines again. We had a Flight AA 705 at the 22nd of May 2023. We had our Check in and after 2 hours the Flight was cancelled. We got our suitcase back at nearly 3 hours later. We got the flight one day later at the 23rd of May. We lost one day of holiday, we paid for one day hotel and Rented a car for nothing in Charlotte. The Hotel we got in Frankfurt was so la la. The vouchers for Lunch and breakfast and drinks were too small to get a lunch. We had a lot of stress on a hot day. After European Law the Airline had to pay 600 Euros per person for these delay. We opened a case, got a number and we are still waiting since the 23rd of June. Result - never again with American Airlines. American Airlines had bad responses of customers."
509,"Not Verified |  Absolutely disgusting. I asked the a flight attendant for some help/support to lift my backpack up to the overhead bins and he kept saying that he cannot because that’s not his job. I just asked for a little support, absolutely unbelievable! I kept telling him I couldn’t reach because I was too short and I could do it myself if I just had an extra person’s support. The trays were not thoroughly cleaned and in the pockets there was still trash. The food was also tasted disgusting. There isn’t even that many movies & tv shows to choose from. I will never be taking American Airlines ever again. An absolute trash airline! They have no respect for passengers at all."
510,Not Verified |  Today was the perfect demonstration of putting greed and corporate goals before Customer Service. As someone who is a huge rule follower even I thought this was unnecessary and just petty. It demonstrated that all this airline cares about is the bottom line - yes money! My husband and I paid approximately an additional $26-36 per seat for the “upgraded” seats we chose. Keep in mind no other seats were available that were not an additional charge. I honestly don’t see what sets them apart from Spirit Airlines. We along with another gentlemen were the last to board the plane and the entire exit row isle was unoccupied so instead of taking the crowded row we were assigned to we quickly identified that row was open and sat in those empty seats and so did the gentlemen that boarded along with us. Keep in mind my husband is 6 ft 3 inches so an exit row would have been way more comfortable for him but instead the attendant quickly sprinted over to us to advise us that those seats were upgrades and also reminded us that we “didn’t pay” for them. I respectfully asked her if there was anyone else boarding the plane and if the seats were taken and she said “no.” I then asked her so wouldn’t it be better to have someone in the exit row to be able to assist in an emergency? She continued to give me the same answer. I quickly realized this attendant was not interested in winning the customer service badge today it was “follow the rules” day and she was well trained. I quickly gathered my belongings and moved the tow behind the empty exit row. A few minutes later another attendant walked over and thanked us for moving and advised us that there were Corporate Employees on board. That quickly told me that these employees are being raised up to follow the Corporate mission. Profit before Service! I now understand why Southwest has better ratings! Never again American!
511,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines kept delaying my flight to New Orleans where I was meeting family flying in from another state as well. My flight was delayed for 5.5 hours. When asked what the problem was, no one knew and no one cared. They also kept changing my departure gate and ended up going to another terminal. The flight attendant on the last leg of my flight to New Orleans was rude and snarky. This was my first and last trip with American Airlines."
512,"Not Verified |  For the last three times I have flown with my family, we have been separated. I have flown for over 20 years and only in the past year, I have not been allowed to sit with my kids. This last time, I just flew with my daughter and our seats were not together. I am aware that our tickets are economy; however, this is a change that airlines are including to make customers pay more for already expensive tickets, which to me is an abuse. If people continue taking these small changes without complaining, airlines will continue adding stupid charges to already high priced tickets. I paid over $230 per ticket to fly from Omaha to Phoenix (2.5 hours). I am thinking that the least I could expect is to seat with my 15 year old daughter without having to pay any extra money."
513,Not Verified |  This review is for a schedule change to my upcoming domestic flight to West Palm Beach. They changed my departures Over 2 hours difference each flight but are refusing refund Because it's not 4 hours! The guidelines are excessive and not highlighted during booking. The airline is not flexible nor accommodating. I am their credit card holder but that's not helping me. What happened to American Airlines? Not happy at all!
514,"✅ Trip Verified | Initial flight from SJO to MIA, easy check in. No priority channel or airline lounge so used priority pass. Flight left on time. Clean 737. Pre take off drinks offered with full bar options. Once air borne excellent cabin crew and good meal option. Short haul business/ first seat is spacious with good recline, much better than European carriers short haul product in all respects. Transit at MIA was ok. Flagship lounge of excellent quality and easy to access showers which were spacious and well maintained. Flight left on time, welcome drink was plastic clear receptacle containing warm Prosecco, this, I’m afraid is below that standard I would expect in premium cabins where champagne is expected. Once airborne, cabin crew were pleasant and helpful and delivered good meal service and food was very good. Lie flat was comfortable and slept well. Arrivals lounge at LHR was good and food options excellent. All considering a very good flight."
515,"Not Verified |  They don’t know what punctuality is! Issues exiting the first plane, they couldn’t open the door and took a while for the right people to come and fix it. Second plane was delayed. Customer service wasn’t great either."
516,"✅ Trip Verified |  Thank you American Airlines for destroying an entire day of my vacation. A simple 40 minute flight ending up taking 5 hours to even board because their planes are getting too hot. Too bad, that is none of our problems and we’re the ones who pay for it in the end. In an era where people can barely afford taking vacations, they exacerbate the problem by ruining the days of several planefuls of people. Worst flight I’ve ever taken. But it’s okay, they gave us $24 in meal vouchers, which translates to 2 candy bars and 2 sodas at the airport. "
517,"✅ Trip Verified | A 1:30 hour flight that was meant to depart at 2:30 led me to waste my whole day because of some mismanagement. They delayed the flight several times beforehand eventually cancelling it later on there was no proper communication to the customers and absolute ignorance towards us. Also they didn’t provide us any compensation as we were delayed for over 5 hours eventually cancelling the flight. Worst experience ever will not recommend to anyone literally wasted my whole day cause of their mismanagement. They booked us for next day at the same time, my mom is in a wheelchair and the flight was delayed 5 hours. Nobody could help me to look for a place for her to rest. They don't care about people. They only want our money and because of them, my mom was not able to attend a very important appointment."
518,"Not Verified |  This airline seems to be in its last throes; no control of their scheduling, lack of information, you travel at your own peril, not knowing if and when your plane will ever leave. This airline should disappear from the market once and for all, for the good of the public."
519,"Not Verified |  Don't waste your time flying with American Airlines. If you want to be delayed, have the gates changed multiple times and baggage claim location changed on you then fly with AA."
520,"✅ Trip Verified |  AA is really turning to the dark side. We would always book the cheapest AA tickets and could always talk with agents and get them changed if we needed to (assuming it was over 2 weeks out, etc), but no more. This apparently changed recently without warning. We've been trying to bump back a flight to a later date and every rep we've talked to has been not only unhelpful, but rude about it to boot. Seems like AA is becoming another victim of the race to the bottom for terrible customer service."
521,"Not Verified | My American Airlines flight was canceled and I am not happy about this. I expect to be reimbursed for this terrible and traumatic experience! If your people had remorse or even acted like they cared, it would be different. No one smiles. No one apologizes. No one seems to care about their respect for YOUR customers. What happened to ""owning"" your business? What happened to treating people the way YOU want to be treated? What happened to wanting to take more of the market share? What happened to wanting to take the business from your competitors instead of running customers off to the point to where they never want to fly American Airlines again? AND I WILL BE CANCELING MY AA Aviator credit card because of this fiasco. The only time you can understand the person on the airplane speaker AND the only time they sound enthusiastic or NICE is when they are talking about the AA credit card. Ice chips (like hail) coming out of the AC vents on outbound flight as well as 1st rebound flight 4584. To start, I had a nonstop flight from LGA in NY to HOU in Texas on 6/26 at 8am and when American Airlines rebooked me, I then had 3 (THREE) stops on the NEXT day. So, on 6/27 at 4:58pm, 32 hours from my original departure time, I was set to start my long journey back home. I paid for my seat choices on 3 flights instead of 1. I paid for my checked bags on 3 flights instead of 1 I paid for hotel rooms in states in Virginia and North Carolina. I'm sick of customer service offering me a $25.00 travel voucher!"
522,"Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible. If you want to be threatened, have your flight cancelled, delayed, rescheduled multiple times then choose American Airlines. If you want to be removed from your flight when it's boarding, then choose American airline. They have the rudest customer service I've ever witnessed. They'll hang up on you as you're asking a question or call you a liar if you're at the desk. Had the manager tell me I couldn't get a transportation voucher a week ahead of time and to call a 1-800 number to then call the 1-800 number and be told it's not possible to call and get a voucher. Missed 2 days worth of business meetings, had 3 flight delays, got removed from my flight, got threatened against trying to get my bag.  The only way to get any kind of compensation is to fill out a form on their website where they don't even reply! It's been almost 2 weeks and haven't heard anything back from them. I booked with a different airline for my return flight and didn't even take my trip back with them."
523,"✅ Trip Verified |  We were traveling to Puerto Vallarta for our sons wedding. Flying out of STL, connecting in DFW, we arrived 3hrs early for a 7am flight, the flight was delayed 30 min. So I called AA and made sure we were still good for our connection. As soon as I got off the phone the flight was delayed for 7 hours, I called again and was on hold. I went to stand in line for the gate agent who took an hour before we finally made it to the desk, who then said I needed to go to ticketing. At the same time I was searching for other flights to make it to Mexico in time for the wedding (all while still on hold). When we got up to ticketing there was a long line and only about 2 people assisting (and one guy on the phone the entire time - not helping the line). When I finally reached the desk, I pointed out a Delta flight that would get us there and the agent said well you would have had to be checked in on the flight by 730 so I can't put you on it (it was 735). After two hours on hold they finally answered. They then booked us on a flight to charlotte and then on to Dallas - so we could make the DFW to PVR trip the next day and still make it in time for the wedding. We go back through security and to our gate (no meal voucher, and they told us that we would get a hotel voucher in Dallas). When boarding flight 831 to CLT they made us gate check our bags (our only luggage) after boarding the plane they had mechanical issues and removed all passengers. They said Mechanical issues and it would only be 45 minutes. We received a notification on the app that we had been rebooked. and would again miss our flight in DFW and miss the wedding. At this point we knew it would be faster to drive the 10hrs to Dallas to make our flight the next morning since American could not find any other way to get us to get us to Mexico in time. We stood in line again at the gate agent to see what we could do about the bags that we were forced to check. They said they would not pull bags off of the flight and that we would get them in Dallas. So we got in our car and drove the 10hrs to DFW, we immediately went to the ticket desk and asked about our bags (the Charlotte flight eventually took off around 9pm so about 7 hrs late), The agent informed us that our bags will be catching up with us and be there when we arrive in PVR. 2 gate changes later we boarded and made it to Puerto Vallarta. Our bags didn't arrive. We immediately filed a missing baggage report with the AA representative and continued on our way (having to purchase clothes and necessities since our bags were lost/ delayed) We had to cancel our leg from DFW to STL on the way home since our car was there and drive home. We have since filed not only baggage but an expenses claim. Our baggage was denied since we were ""voluntarily separated"" from our bags, even though we were forced to check them, were rebooked by AA and still made the DFW flight that we needed. So all clothes and necessities will not be compensated. Also, I filed for expenses and AA was lovely enough to give me a $25 credit (delayed over 24hrs, canceled flight, had to drive to 1200 miles and lost luggage) Should have just slapped me in the face. I won't be flying American again."
524,Not Verified |  What a horrible experience. The flight was supposed to take off at around 4:30 and was a 50 min flight but it turned out to be the worst experience ever. The flight was delayed on several instances and eventually dragged with a 5 hr delay later in getting canceled and leaving customers frustrated and confused with limited options. The service was very poor absolutely no communication and no compensation provided financially or any aid to customers as we were waiting over for 5 hrs a better sitting area would have been nice. But cause of their mismanagement and mistakes we suffered and had to ditch out plans and literally waste a whole day
525,Not Verified |  A 1 hr flight that was meant to depart at 4:30 led me to waste my whole day because of some mismanagement. They delayed the flight several times beforehand eventually cancelling it later on there was no proper communication to the customers and absolute ignorance towards us. Also they didn’t provide us any compensation in terms of financial compensation or providing a lounge as we were delayed for over 5 hrs eventually cancelling the flight. Worst experience ever will not recommend to anyone literally wasted my whole day cause of their mismanagement.
526,"Not Verified |  After trying unsuccessfully to purchase a ticket online, the American app went down. When I called merely to complete my purchase, the airline increased the rate by over $900 from what I would have paid if their app worked correctly. They do not honor their online listed rates."
527,"✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely disappointed in American! Agents at gate boarded us on the plane knowing there was not a pilot onboard. He was on a required 10 hour rest period. When pilot arrived (45 minutes later than departure time) he left door opened allowing other travelers that were late getting to Chicago to catch the flight going to San Diego. After roughly 1-1/2 hours the door was closed. We stayed at the gate waiting. Now a storm had moved in and the plane started toward the runway. Lightning was spotted so we sat and waited. After 3 hours we were given a snack and a drink. After about 4-1/2 hours we were told the San Diego airport closes at midnight and our plane would not make that time so our flight was canceled. It was roughly 1am in the morning and no one from American would assist us with rebooking/hotels/or rides. Everyone was on their own to try to reassemble the mess American made. The closest hotel we could find with any vacancy was roughly 15 miles away and $280. I was able to find seats on the same flight number for the next night by calling American on the phone. Our original tickets were for extra legroom, my wife was able to get an exit row seat but I did not and was told I would get reimbursed for the difference. After sending this information to American Airlines via email on their website, I received a $25 voucher from American. I tried to reach out again to the company but have yet to hear anything. Giving it a 1 out of 10 because 0 was not an option."
528,Not Verified |  I frequently fly this route and flight is delayed most of the time. Today it has been delayed three times and now they are saying that crew staff is also late and we have wait till they arrive even though aircraft may be here. Never has such poor service with other airlines. I have decided to not use AA unless I absolutely have to. Very disappointing!
529,✅ Trip Verified |  Rude people. Flight delayed 8 plus hours. Inability to get airplane to boarding dock once landed. Angry because I handedness slept in a day and a half trying to get a couple hundred miles. Terrible airline. Plus the wifi freezes up. 
530,"Not Verified | The worst airline ever. The flight got delayed 3 times! We were on our way from Tampa, Florida to Richmond, Virginia until they changed the time. This is absolutely unacceptable!"
531,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight delayed 4 times which caused missed connections. Called customer service, unable to give any kind of refund due to the inconvenience. Asked for meal vouchers, was told gate agent could issue. Asked gate agent in Traverse City and he flat out refused."
532,"✅ Trip Verified | Numerous delays, rude staff, they also changed my seat from outside to centre so I was stuck in the middle on multiple flights, so choosing your seat is basically pointless. There was a flight direct to my destination that I was at the gate for, and they announced that the flight was not full, I asked to be moved to that flight and they told me no with no discussion. So I waited and was delayed 4 times. I could of rented a car and arrived sooner and paid way less."
533,Not Verified |  Cancelled my flight 2 hours before departure. They were unable to give me a flight until 2 days later and could not answer questions about the refund process. Horrible customer service and an utter lack of care for customer's schedules. Shameful airline. Now i have to pay $1700 for flights for my partner and I that are on average $300-$600. Avoid at all cost.
534,Not Verified |  Absolute trash of an airline. Constantly delayed flights. Ticket reps could not care less. 
535,"Not Verified |  Will never fly with them again! Seems delaying their flights is consistent for them after reading other reviews. Flight was supposed to leave at 4:45pm we didn't end up leaving until almost 7pm. I wasn't even made aware as to why there was a delay! Also wasn't made aware until getting to the airport in a completely different country that not only was there a delay but that I would not make my 9pm flight to make it home and that there was no other flight available that night and I would have to be stuck in Philadelphia and fly to Boston at 10:30am tomorrow to then make it to my destination not until 4 in the evening the next day! Unbelievable. I did not see anyone else's flights delayed but ours. After being frantic and calling to receive some type of help I didn't get anywhere and absolutely nobody seemed to care! This involved me and several other people as well. Luckily since they are so good at making sure flights are delayed the 9pm was moved to 9:35pm. Me and 10 other passengers rushed/ran as fast as we could to catch the plane to make it home and were able to make it but due to them updating everyone's boarding passes to tomorrow we all had to wait for them to adjust it and find us seats. The plane was not clean at all, no tv's and if you want wifi it's $15 for an hour. I will definitely stick with Delta. What a difference between the two! Arrived back home to find out my bags as well as everyone else's is still stuck in Philadelphia so now I pray and hope those make it back to me! First and last time flying with AA! Never again!"
536,"Not Verified |  I purchased a ticket and had to change the name of the person flying with me so instead of just charging me for the name change they charged me $591 for a whole new ticket! Such a rip-off, I'll never fly American Airlines again."
537,✅ Trip Verified |  I had a noon to 9 pm flight. I checked in like normal and waited 3.5 hours to board. Canceled noon flight. No drinks on flight. Landed and no handicapped assistance. I waited 45 mins in TSA through handicapped because I joined up with another lady. 20 min wait through normal TSA. They moved our gate 3 Times. I had to walk again 3 miles in 2.5 hr. Waited 50 mins in line for food vouchers and ran out of time as flight boarding in 20 mins. Landed 12:35 midnight. I screamed at associate in AA lounge because they wouldn't even give me a drink. Back hurt next day so bad I spent 3 day in bed. I filed complaint 21 days ago and no response. 
538,"✅ Trip Verified |  I don’t know how to put into words the absolute misery American Airlines inflicts on passengers with impunity. They delayed my flight from Dallas Fort Worth to Seattle 4 times. The flight was at 10:30 pm, then 11:15, then 11:30, then 12:30, then 1:30 am and then they announced it was cancelled and had to move everyone to the 10:30 am flight the next day. Some people at ticketing said the issue was weather. This is patently false because other flights are making it out just fine. Another said they had no pilots. I am not sure that they will even have pilots for the rescheduled flight, yet on their website they are selling the same flight at an earlier time. The airport here in Dallas is absolutely littered with folks whose flights have been cancelled and have been stranded here because of American’s absolute idiocracy. I vow to never fly with them again and plan to tell anyone and everyone in my circle to avoid this airline. It’s absolutely disgusting how they continue to get away with these actions on this scale."
539,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was delayed then night before without reason. We get there and it was delayed two more times and then cancelled. Due to weather. Make that make sense. It barely rained also. We go to figure out what’s going on and no reimbursement because “weather” how convenient. They automatically booked us on the flight the next day and told us our luggage would be sent with it. Excuse me but I need my stuff for the night. So we waited 3 hours to have our luggage sent out. Every single employee gave us a different story. We watched them belittle anyone who asked about their luggage, call the police on a man because he refused to take his bag. His bag was open and his stuff was all over the floor next to it and the employee kicked his bag to him: then she told him to lower his voice. None of us could hear him, he kept his cool. She was yelling. I will never fly them again. They said I can’t have a refund because my ticket had a no refund policy, they’re the ones who cancelled the flight. I finally got a refund and booked United. The flight they had put me on tomorrow is already delayed. Thank god for United airlines"
540,✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines sucks. Flight delayed hours and hours. You cannot talk to an actual human over the phone to help you with “fixing” it. You have to fill out a complaint form and an airline representative told me “there is no telling” when they will get back to me. Absolutely ridiculous!
541,"Not Verified | This is a long story but maybe others have had similar travel nightmares and can relate to my frustration and disappointment with American Airlines. We flew home from Cayman Islands Monday, June 26 and landed around 3:30pm in Charlotte, North Carolina. Our flight home wasn't scheduled to depart until 10:30pm, but instead was delayed several times and ultimately canceled because of a potential thunderstorm. We were stranded at the airport with no transportation, and ended up staying in a filthy hotel just to have a place to sleep for the night. Our flight was rescheduled at American Airline's earliest convenience, which wasn't until FRIDAY. They would not offer any accommodations for us if we ended up staying. We ended up paying close to $3000 for a flight from Charlotte to Cleveland, and rented a car to get home. Altogether with the hotel, flight, food, and car rental we paid close to $3600 just to get home. I'm very disappointed in American Airlines and the way they are handling this situation. I can't help but think of the money they can make off of people desperately trying to get home."
542,"✅ Trip Verified | This airline is terrible. Rent a car way less people and delays. Got delayed hours both ways. Staffing weather, nothing but excuses and insincere apologies. Sell the airline to persons that care about customer service"
543,"Not Verified | I have been traveling all over the world but my last visit to the UK made biggest mistake of my life choosing American airlines. Worse customer service to worse in flight service, non professional staff that didn't know the difference between regular food and special food ordered by the passenger. Bad attitude."
544,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was cancelled while we were en route to airport. AA stranded us in a foreign country (it was spring break and our hotel was sold out so we had nowhere to stay). We initially had a nonstop AM flight, late that night, AA managed to get us into the US but cancelled our connecting flight and couldn't tell us when they'd be able to fly us out. The line for customer service stretched all the way down the terminal (AA claimed storms in the midwest were the issue, however no other airline was cancelling flights. I presume some of them also fly through the midwest). After an hour in line, while simultaneously holding for an agent on the phone, we were told they couldn't get us home until two days later. I wound up buying tickets on United just to get my kids back in time for school. I've flown at least six legs on American so far this year and not a single one left on time nor landed on time."
545,Not Verified | It is unbelievable  This is my 2nd time to fly from Miami to Tampa. Only 1/2 hr flight but every time it is a 5 hours delay and stay in the aircraft all time. If I can give you minus 5 I would. I have no respect for this airline at all 
546,✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines moved my seat from and isle to an window seat 15 min before boarding without my consent. I am a large shouldered tall man and barely fit in the aisle. American Airlines would not correct the error. I was crammed against the window on an isle with two other men next to me. American Airlines is terrible.
547,"✅ Trip Verified |  Returning from a trip to Belize, flying American Airlines  which had only one connecting flight at the Dallas / Ft. Worth airport, we arrived (first class) in Chicago, very late at night. Upon checking in to a hotel, before driving home the next day, I opened my suitcase to find that it had been rifled through! Zippers had been left open and items were all over the suitcase and mixed in with my clothes! Even my dopp kit was open and many of the bathroom items were scattered among my things! As late as it was and as frustrating as this poor handling of my things was, I decided to let it go, until the next morning. As we approached our car, I remembered that I had to get the fob for the vehicle out of my suitcase. It was nowhere to be found. It is my unswerving habit, when traveling, to transfer the fob to the suitcase, upon arrival at wherever will be “home base” during any vacation. That fob was in the suitcase during the entire vacation. Keep in mind that any baggage issues need to be reported to AA within ridiculously short periods of time to have any hope of processing a claim! Luckily, I acted pretty quickly and sent a message describing what had happened. Unluckily, I was now entering the Twilight Zone of such claims processes with AA! They sent a reply with a link to their claims process. Immediately, it was evident that this could not be done automatically. AA’s auto system will absolutely not let you submit any claim that does not have a specific receipt for the item lost. No flexibility. No options offered. So, now I’m through the looking glass of trying to handle this by phone. The first person listened to the whole thing and told me he was not the right person, but would transfer me. I, having dealt with many such customer service systems said (very nicely) that I’d rather not explain that same story seven times. Was the next dept. going to be the correct one? “Oh, yes sir.” Of course, it was not. After explaining it 2 more times, I got the proper dept. Now, came the requests for receipts again! This is a fob! It has no specific receipt. I calmly said that I thought a call to Belize City and Dallas airports to check their found items might do the trick. I was placed on hold and, when she got back on the phone, I was told that Belize City did not have it and Dallas Ft. Worth was their headquarters and was so busy that it would be hard to get a hold of anyone! That needs repeating, Dallas Ft. Worth was their headquarters and was so busy that it would be hard to get a hold of anyone! After way too much chat, it was decided I could send proof of the car purchase, of all the insane things. Also, they wanted an estimate of replacement value. So, I went to our initial dealership and got the parts dept. to send me an estimate, which I forwarded to AA, with proof of flights and ID. The estimate clearly pointed out that the fob transmitter is $101.30, the physical key kept inside the fob is $62.66, and the programming of the fob to our vehicle (absolutely necessary, as is known by anyone who has operated a vehicle with such a device!) $165. With tax, the total was going to be $347.05. They took all this info. and replied that they would be sending a check for $80.75! And, it was going to be 30 days!"
548,✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airline. I have a temporary disability that has me confined to a wheelchair. I requested assistance in advance to help me get on and off the plane and to make connections. At Dallas airport my incoming flight was delayed because of equipment blocking the gate. The gate attendant stated I did not have time to use the restroom but when I explained I was happy to use the plane facilities with assistance I was told no. I expressed that I did not want to take a later flight but if that I was not allowed 5 minutes to use the restroom prior to the flight ( a three hour flight) that I would have to get up during the flight and that if I fell it would be the airline’s responsibility. The gate attendant then stated that she would not allow me on my scheduled flight regardless of my request to not be moved to a later flight. She was extremely rude and talked over me when I tried to explain that I could not get out of my seat while in flight without assistance. This airline claims to accommodate disabled people but I did not feel they even tried in this instance.  Absolutely no compassion whatsoever. I tried to file a complaint with the airline regarding this matter and although the customer service that helped me write the complaint was wonderful the response I received was a very generic reply. I have been unable to speak to anyone regarding this and the email response to my submission was basically an apology “but we don’t feel as though our employees did anything wrong!” So in summary I will never fly with American again and I definitely would say that in regards to accommodations for people with disabilities they probably don’t even comply with the basics required. I definitely felt discriminated against. I was out right bullied by their employee and was literally in tears at their treatment. Not to mention their follow up on the complaint was basically almost worse than no response at all!
549,✅ Trip Verified | Literally every time I fly American there is always a delay or problem. I fly at least 10x/year. Save yourself the trouble and do not book American Airlines. You will run into some sort of hassle that could have easily prevented but AA is poorly run. Better off flying Delta if possible.
550,"Not Verified | I had a very important question about my flight and was unable to get actual answers from customer service. Calling was useless, with extremely long wait times, then an agent who couldn't answer my question. AA offers zero email or chat support options! Their website only lets you contact them about a short list of very specific issues. But a general question about my flight? Apparently I'm not allowed to ask that. Caused a lot of unnecessary stress that could have been avoided if they simply offered a support email like every other company does. Ridiculous that I can't get simple answers."
551,"Not Verified | Absolutely horrible experience from beginning to end. Every flight (4 total) was delayed or canceled so we had to be rescheduled, our checked bag was lost on our way to our destination, and we did not talk to a single helpful or kind employee (out of about 10 different people we spoke to). We spent 2 weeks just trying to get at least a partial refund for the tickets, considering how awful everything was and I finally got a single email back that essentially said ""sorry about your trip, we understand! The best we can do is give you some miles and a $50 credit on your account!"" The trip cost $1500 for 2 people round trip and was just awful with rude employees. We've agreed we never want to fly American again, so their ""tangible apology"" is absolutely useless to us. If I could give them a 0 I would. Please save yourself do not fly American Airlines."
552,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight delayed by 2 hours and once we boarded, the plane was not cleaned from the flight before. The previous passengers dirty tissue was in my backseat storage and when I used a disinfectant wipe to clean my seat’s arm rests and my tray table, the wipe was almost black from how dirty it was. The service was terrible and the crew was very off putting and rude to everyone. There was very little leg room compared to other airlines, and there was limited inflight entertainment options by comparison, Delta has live TV and over 1,000 TV shows and Movies to watch for free, and they provide you with earbuds. Flying with American Airlines is the dumbest thing a human being could ever possibly do."
553,"Not Verified |  Multiple trips with AA, all of them garbage. Delays with no warning or explanation, blatant disregard for weather advisories, last-minute cancellations with no hope of rebooking, and ""it's not the airline's fault, so we're not gonna give you lodging, or even a place to sit for that matter."" Every single time something goes wrong, and we're left stranded at a connecting airport for hours with no explanation or concern on their part."
554,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible airline and worst customer service at the NY airport. They almost made us miss my flight. Firstly our baggage was delayed due to weather. Not their fault but when I tried asking the ground crew if I’ll still make it for My flight, she gave me a nonchalant answer that the flight could be delayed up to cancellation. What kind of answer is that? They would not confirm. We were already on a short transfer schedule. When we came to the recheck-in baggage crew gave wrong information. The one older lady Made us waste 15 mins of waiting time because she did not tell us that we could just place our bags on the conveyer belt since it’s tagged all the way to destination. Lucky I asked another employee and she said we could just put the bags in the belt. Miscommunication everywhere! Now onto the flight service. We were on flight AA 300 which left at 10pm on 7/29. The flight attendant was the more unfriendly and stern person I’ve ever seen on a flight. She did not smile once and even saw her impatiently and sternly reprimanding passengers. The service was horrible. They only offered us drink including water once with a meal. Nothing after that. The attendants were no where to be seen throughout the flight until almost landing time. Ridiculous! Will never fly with AA again especially via NY. I’m an avid world traveler and so embarrassed to see my country’s flagship airline has such horrible service and attitude from the crew."
555,Not Verified |  We flew American down to Roatan. The flight down was ok it was overbooked and the staff tried to sell us a credit card that was not worth the annual fee. The pilot was very nice and it was to be expected for an economy seat. However the boarding process is illogical and stupid boarding customers who paid for a seat before those who did not regardless of seat position. We were in 15E and F and we boarded after someone seated in the back and front of the plane. As a result it was sheer chaos getting on board. I know they want to make money but lets all save time and just board front to back or back to front like ever other logical airline. Mythbusters had an entire episode about this but clearly the CEOs of AA do not watch anything other than thier bank accounts. On the way back it gets worse we were delayed 4 hours because the airplane decided to take a nap in Miami. I have no idea why it takes 4 hours to service an airplane and how you know it will be delayed 9 hours before you board and still are not able to do anything but rebook a person on a flight that is overnight in a totally different city and not the one that they land in for the flight that leaves the next day. Again defies logic. I have been delayed before but at least there was a reason needless to say I will not be flying AA again. This is coming from someone has flown Ryanair many times.
556,"✅ Trip Verified |  Without a doubt, the worst flight experience of my entire life. The staff is so rude. So unhelpful. Questions on checking your bags? Forget it. Questions regarding why your flight has been delayed 3 times?  This airline is so blatant on the fact that they do not care about their customers at all. They don't even pretend to! Not only did we sit on the tarmac for 3 hours waiting to take off because it was hot outside but we were treated like burdens by the entire staff throughout the duration of the whole ordeal. The AA staff inside the actual airports are the worst by far though as far as rudeness goes. Seriously, do yourself a favor and do your research before booking with anyone. Especially AA. The bad reviews are legit and you'll find that I am not the only one who feels the way I do. Not by a long shot. Make wise decisions for yourself and loved ones to give them a positive flight experience."
557,"Not Verified |  We had an amazing flight there and back for our honeymoon in Aruba. Our flight attendant Krishana was such an amazing person, that made us feel so special and welcomed on the flight. She deserves an award, because she is patient about making the customers feel good and comfortable during their flights."
558,"Not Verified |  This isn't about one flight, this is about multiple times that we flew AA, said give them one more chance. This is about 5 and 6 hour flight delays with excuses as long as your arm. Running out of fuel, its hot (yes, that was an actual excuse), we need to get back in line, on and on. Their record with us is about 50 percent on time, the rest some version of mega late. Worst of all, it costs us every time they screw up; a missed motel, an added motel, extra days at the kennel, tours missed, rental cars and rooms that are sub par left over because American Airlines cant be bothered with details such as on time. When a service costs me more than its cost to fix the damage, its time to toss it. Im just not going to fly with them as late is their goal."
559,"Not Verified |  The worst flying experience of my life. Eleven delays over an 8 hour period, with continuous lies from gate staff regarding the flight status. Wound up stuck over night at the airport, American did the same thing to me two years ago, hadn’t flown with them since, and never will again. Beyond awful."
560,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines is the worst airline in the US. They treat you so bad that it looks like they are trained to make you feel terrible. The people at the counter show no respect for you or your belongings, and they ignore anything you have to say. They scream at you and threaten to remove you from the flight if you ask for anything. They also charge extra fees for everything, and have an extremely disorganized boarding process. "
561,"✅ Trip Verified | I had sworn off American Airlines a year ago after poor customer service, but tried again this year to fly home from Belize. Huge mistake. American flights are notoriously late as was the case with my flight again. The flight attendants offered no help when questioning about customs in the Miami airport and used her standard, “I don’t know” answer to every question. Due to the late flight, thousands of passengers arrived at the same time to check out through customs. We knew we would miss our connection and began trying to work out overnight accommodations, but no American Airline employee can assist over the phone, this leading to standing in 3 lines for a total of 4 hours. American knew all these passengers would be late arriving but closed down the help desks to two people handling all the people. American has the absolute worst customer service of the many airlines I have traveled. It happens every single time. This is your advance warning - do not use them even if the price is better. Not worth the hassle and ignorance of employees!"
562,"✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines has lost any sense of urgency. Shrouded in the incompetent cloak of blame TSA, blame air traffic control, blame the ramp team. The bottom line is you are late —- you miss your flight and the couldn’t give a flip less. Thanks Boston team on AA0415. You ruined my trip, my evening and my work day because you couldn’t hold AA1494 just eight minutes. Especially when you do it when it suits you. New rule. I will drive anything 10 hours. 10 flipping hours rather than deal with your self entitled drama."
563,"Not Verified | Horrible customer service over the phone. Dealt with a life or death emergency flight and explained my entire situation. Spoke with roughly 5 different representatives to manage cancelling my flight. 4/5 representatives assured me my refund would go through as I cancelled less than 24hrs from the time I purchased. 2 WEEKS later I get an email stating my refund is not possible nor exchangeable although it is mentioned on their website that it IS possible. Last representative I spoke with even mentioned waiting A DAY to process my refund and when I explained that 4 representatives told me what to do she stated, ""You can do what they told you or you can do what I'm telling you to do its your call"" and hung up on my call. Left her a bad review on the after-call survey and still ended up waiting 2 weeks for no other communication other than my money being lost and gone. Not the first issue I've had with this airline and will never fly with them again NOR recommend to anyone."
564,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst experience I have ever had. While coming back from India, AA didn't gave me any baggage allowance for my international flight ticket. I have pay for my luggage and then they suggested me to claim a refund. So after coming back I have to go through that hassle too. They are supposed to give us 3 meals in our 16 hour flight where as they just gave us 2 meals and they skipped the other meal by giving us an ice cream only. I'll not recommend this airline at all. If they can't give proper service, they should shut it down."
565,Not Verified |  Arrived 1.45 hours before flight. Missed flight due to check in staff unable to process a short line of people in an efficient manner. Watched 6 check in staff unable to process a short line of 20 people in 45 minutes. The incompetence was astounding to have missed a flight due to a simple process of checking people in. Instead they dilly dallied on just a few customers never thinking nor caring that they are making others miss their flights. I don't believe they are unaware of their actions. They simply don't give a damn.
566,"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Dallas Fort-Worth onboard AA2833 on their A321-200. My flight departed from the rather small-sized Terminal 4, and with the amount of layover I had plus the quick service in Los Angeles, I had plenty of time to kill in the Admirals Club lounge which was very cozy and comfortable. The staff in Los Angeles were just okay. Boarding started on schedule and it was very disciplined, and I was welcomed in quite a friendly way by the crews. Take-off was only 10 minutes late, but eventually, we landed half an hour ahead of schedule. Their A321 had slightly larger overhead bins and strip LED lighting, but sadly no personal TVs. The seat was cozy and comfortable, easy to use, and adequately spacious for a 2.5-hour flight like this. Throughout the flight, the flight attendants were friendly, courteous, and attentive, although they could've been better if they were not just meddling with their phones and re-ensure that everyone is doing okay. once the service is complete. The Biscoff biscuit was exquisite and tasty. The real positive thing about this flight was the Wi-Fi. It allowed me to browse anything, open social media apps, and watch videos on the ground for around 20 minutes. Once I took off, the social media apps and browsing feature no longer existed, but live TV shows, videos, movies, and games were provided through the American Airlines portal. The signal strength was quite poor, but the contents and the layout of the portal were incredibly good. Despite landing 30 minutes ahead of schedule, the baggage delivery at Dallas Fort Worth was ridiculously slow, causing me to wait around 45-60 minutes. Overall, my experience and first impression onboard American Airlines was somewhat impressive. Also, if you're asking for help, contact them via Twitter or use the Live Chat feature. They can sometimes be faster than the phone team."
567,"✅ Trip Verified |  Completely awful airline. This is the only airline that I have horrible experiences with. The first time I had a horrible experience I figured it was a one off, this last time they canceled my flight last minute after delaying it three times. I had a jump on a random flight and pay a Uber driver almost $400 to drive me 2 1/2 hours from one airport home because I had to be home to my kids and work. As they did not give me options I had to figure this out myself then they completely lost my bag. It has been all over the US. I get different stories from every person I speak to. I’ve spoken to seven different people and they’ve all giving me different stories. When I reached out to American, they offered me a $25 flight credit. It was almost insulting after everything I had been through with this airline and all the hoops I had to jump through and they lost my bag to offer me $25 flight credit thinking I would ever fly with them again is horrible. I highly recommend even if it another airline is more expensive. It is way worth it. It is not worth going through what I went through and nobody that works for them will care."
568,"Not Verified | 7 hour flight and no meals or snacks (other than biscoff cookies). Website indicates snack boxes for purchase. Not the case for most on the flight. I didn't think I needed to pack my own food for the kids because I usually fly Delta. Also, I almost missed my flight because they moved it up 2 hours and sent NO notifications of the change. Luckily I double checked my flight the night before."
569,"Not Verified |  This was in regards to attempting business travel and not finding resolution in the online available connections offered. I decided to determine what flights were actually available from RDU through Charlotte onto final destination of STL. Finding the options I needed, I called ""customer service"" to ask if they could simply join the individual segments I found since it wasn't being offered as connecting flights on AA.com. The CSR said it's called a ""Merit"" itinerary (or something like that) and quoted a price about 50% higher than those offered online. The csr had a poor attitude, very terse in his interaction with me and ultimately did not care about my satisfaction. But, I believe it's a larger problem at American Airlines. If I need to travel to a final destination and must connect through another city and flights are published on AA.com in individual segments and are available, why can't American Airlines accommodate the customer and simply book the individual flights at no additional cost to a loyal customer? I've noticed this being true with Award Travel - whoever is in charge of managing the connecting schedules for those customers who need to travel with connections, is not at all customer-focused and needs to attend a few seminars on how to continue to satisfy the customer. "
570,"Not Verified |  American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown with. I will never, every fly with them again. My most recent trip was a nightmare. First, our flight was cancelled and this didn’t notify us. We waited to check-in and check our bags for over 2 hours before we found out our flight was cancelled. They managed to get us on another flight, but then we sat in the plain without moving for 2 hours. Apparently, they didn’t know how to weigh the plane. At least, that’s the excuse they gave when they started making the flight attendants count the passengers, and that was after an hour and half of sitting there with no news. Because of that delay, we missed our connecting flight to Japan. We waiting over 2 hours in line for help and would have waiting longer had I not flagged down a random employee and begged for help. They were able to put us on a different route, adding over 12 hours to our trip. To top it off, they lost our baggage. Our baggage sat in the USA for 3 days before they found it and sent it to us. They are the most incompetent, ignorant, sloppy airline I have ever encountered and will now go to great lengths to avoid."
571,"Not Verified |  Like most of the other reviews mine also deals with flight changes, delays, and missed connections. From LAX to PHX the flight went as planned but once in PHX they said we missed connecting flight. We did not miss any flight through fault of our own. The previous day that sent an email that ask to change flights and be compensated. I refused as I had a planned schedule. Since I refused to delay voluntarily I think they just booted me to the later flight. In PHX we were switched to three different gates and two different flights. Our plan included an 5 hour drive from our destination airport, ABQ , to Amarillo which was close to home. We had left our vehicle in ABQ and were suppose to pick it up around 7 PM for our drive home. We ended up in ABQ at almost midnight and we were dead tired so decided to not make the drive and just spend the night. I am currently seeking compensation for the room and expensive meals we had to eat at the airport. I doubt that I will ever choose AA again. I was also not happy with the airplane A320 and the way they seated passengers. We were four, two adults and two teens, The adults were seated 5 rows back from the teens which might not have been so bad if the plane were full but there were empty rows, not seats, rows behind our teens. We also noted three grown men had to share a row when there were plenty of empty seats that they should have been seated in for better comfort."
572,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight to Milwaukee was delayed multiple times for several hours and eventually canceled. I understand things happen and was not initially that upset about the cancelation even though it resulted in me having to sleep on the ground in the airport for 5 hours. My return flight which was 4 days later, was also canceled within hours of departure. This flight was rescheduled for the following day. I have lost all confidence in American Airlines and will avoid flying with them in the future."
573,"✅ Trip Verified |  I will never fly with this airline again. On 7/16, my husband and I were returning from a very much needed vacation from Montego Bay Jamaica and had a connecting flight from MIA to Boston. Upon the flight being delayed 4 times they eventually cancelled the flight all together leaving us confused because this is the first time we've experienced this issue. Lady at the desk told us to rebook at gate 14 so my husband and everyone else went to gate 14 only to find out we were in the wrong place. After waiting 3 hours in line we found out there would be no more flights from MIA to Boston until 2 days later. Both my husband and I were expected to return to work the following day yet now we are stuck in FL for 2 additional days. I went to another gate that had just boarded near by, a flight going to Rio de Janeiro, to ask if they knew where we could find our luggage and to my shock the 2 women behind the desk were talking trash about the people waiting in the now 5 hour line to rebook cancelled flights. I stood there as the 2 employees spoke to each other saying how the people standing in line are ""stupid because they are wasting their time because customer service wont help them"" and laughed about how they would be going home soon after their shifts. Upset I approached the woman behind the desk and let her know that I was one of the people standing in line and looked at me wide eyed as the other employee walked away I asked her if she could do something besides speaking on people she doesn't know and tell me where I can locate my luggage. She told me I would have to go elsewhere to baggage customer service and ask them and told me to please be patient and I replied just like I was now when she felt the need to make fun of people she doesn't know. I walked away and my husband and I went downstairs to find the baggage customer service and after waiting in line yet again for an hour, another employee walked over to tell everyone in line that we are wasting our time. He announced that all the baggage from the canceled flights were in back and no one is going through them because it's too many luggage to go through. Everyone in line became very upset, some yelling at the employee asking what he meant. One man lost his mind telling the baggage guy that the people from upstairs sent him down here for his bags and the baggage guy told him that they only do ticketing and we do baggage and said they don't know what their talking about and no one from the canceled flights would be getting their bags. Angry I went up to the desk to ask if there was anyway possible to retrieve our luggage, we will now be in FL for 2 days without clothes and bags. Also 5mths pregnant, all of my clothes and other things were in my luggage. The lady at the desk told us she had no idea where our luggage is but she would put some note into the system so me and my husband would be able to pick up our luggage at the customer service desk in the morning. Upon searching for hotels for the night as I am pregnant and refused to sleep in the airport and of course everywhere near the airport was booked up. We found a hotel by luck and got there after 5am the next morning 3 more hours later after using Uber to get around town looking for available rooms. Next morning we went back to baggage only to find out the girls note was overridden and our bags were now in Boston so we had no luggage. How are we to be compensated for all the time and money lost dealing with the AA employees?"
574,"Not Verified |  My flight was scheduled to leave at 7:17 am. Since I am supposed to get to the airport 1.5-2 hours before the flight, I was up early and arrived at 5:15am. At 5:36 am I received a notification from American that this flight was delayed until 9:45am because of ""logistical issues"". As a result I missed my connecting flight. I was supposed to get into Little Rock for 11:15am and now have a connecting flight putting me in little rock for 8:26pm. Having read the reviews on American Airlines before booking this flight, I should have heeded the warnings. Lesson learned! Wanted to give American Airlines a chance to prove the reviews wrong. I was wrong, American lives up to its subpar reviews. Because of ""logistical issues"" rearrange my transportation, reservations and housing. I have never flown American before and will never fly them again.  I tried to call American Airlines and was on hold for 36 minutes. Never got to talk to a person.  I fly 6 times a year on average, United, Delta, Jet Blue have been seamless. American is in the bottom tier for a reason, great way to put yourself out of business."
575,"Not Verified |  After delaying our flight for 2 hours, we boarded and then sat on the tarmac for another hour. They then decided to go back to the airport. Waited another 2 hours, boarded again, came off again. This happened 3 times. By 10pm (flight was supposed to leave at 6.15pm), so by this time I knew I missed my connecting flights back to Australia. They decided the Tyre needed replacing. No help with organizing another flight for me (4 flights in total to get back to Australia). No offer of accommodation or food. All I got was “connecting flights will be same tomorrow”, no new boarding passes issued, nothing. Got kicked out of the main airport area at 11pm, so was stuck in the foyer area from 11pm to 6am. At that time I contacted my travel agent to make sure they had me on the next flight, and they didn’t, she lied to me. So I had to try and find a hotel that would take me at 6am in the morning. The hotel that took me is another story. Desperate times call for desperate measures. My travel agent ended up booking my flights 2 days later, no thanks to American Airlines. (Oh, and they also lost my sons bag for 2 weeks, he only had the clothes he was wearing all that time). Got to the airport and funnily enough the same lady that lied to me served me at checkin. “Oh I feel so sorry for you, I’m going to give you an exit row seat on your 1st flight”, she said - little did she know I had paid for the exit row seat just hours before anyway, so it was already my seat. So she lied yet again, pretending to do me a favor! So all in all my son was without everything for 2 weeks, they cancelled my flights twice, no accommodation or food offer, no rescheduling my flights after lying to me saying they were, and it’s been 5 weeks and I’m still trying to get compensated for the Uber costs to and from the hotel, food and accommodation that I had to organise, 1 day of work that I missed. The thing that struck me though, was the complete lack of empathy, they did not care less."
576,"Not Verified |  The flight from Boston to Indianapolis with my partner was not bad, but come back was just miserable all around. I have had several bad experiences with American Airlines on both domestic and international flights in the past; old, dirty planes, lack of any inflight entertainment (other than old drop down ancient TVs from what-appears-to-be from the 1960s), inadequate leg room, etc. But the last few times I have flown with them, it was not too bad and the planes were better; cleaner, etc. but I had one of those experiences again! It was like going back to 2011, 2012 with American! Not only was the plane my partner and I flew this time around; both on the flight to and from, old and decrepit (relatively clean, but extremely dated), there was hardly any legroom whatsoever.  This journey was made even more miserable because one of the flight attendants in the back of the plane was rude and dismissive when I had to get up and use the restroom. She told me to ""sit down because of turbulence"". There was no turbulence at that point. It got to the point where I waved up to another flight attendant at the front of the plane if I could use the restroom up there and he was very friendly and understanding and said I could ""but to make it quick before the turbulence"" and sure enough I was able to do so (it was also an emergency). He was so nice, and I was able to sit back down before the turbulence (which got pretty bad at one point), but the other female flight crew member denying me access to the restroom when there was not any turbulence at one point was rude and unprofessional. I will do everything in my will power to avoid American Airlines at all costs going forward. "
577,Not Verified |  American airlines delayed our flight 5 times in a matter of hours due to personnel issues. This caused us to miss our connecting flight. They wanted to rebook us on a flight 2 days later. It took me 6 hours to get an answer as to why this was happening and find a new way home which was $2000. When I emailed customer relations (no one would speak on the phone) they offered me a $25 travel credit. This doesn't even cover 1 ticket. I don't recommend American airlines.
578,"Not Verified |  American has literally managed to screw every one of my family members on three separate occasions. They delay for no reason. And when they delay, it is so excessive that connecting flights are missed. Do not fly American, you will regret it. It cost me $830 to rebook with another airline. I only got a refund of $300. Worst experience ever. My son is now going to be stuck in New York because of their stupid delays."
579,"Not Verified |  A horrible experience and even worse customer relations after the fact. My most recent flight with American Airlines was delayed by 17 hours and customer relations refuses to give me a refund. I was/am pregnant and was traveling with my 18 month old son. Our layover between flights was supposed to be only 1 hour and turned into a stressful, exhausting 17 hour delay. We waited until 1 am at our gate when we were told to change terminals entirely to go to different gate. After waiting an hour more at this new gate, American Airlines canceled the flight entirely for that night. We were given an $11 meal voucher and told to “book our own hotels” and American would reimburse us. Finally at 4 in the morning I was able to get my 18 month old son to sleep at a hotel we had to book and get an Uber to with no help from American. We only were able to stay for 4 hours before heading back to the airport. When we got back our flight was delayed again. We boarded a plane, we’re told to get off and change planes and wait. It was so tiring and during this time no more meal vouchers were offered so I was paying for everything out of pocket. I missed two days of work because of this fiasco. Since this trip from hell, I have been contacting American Airlines and offered no refunds or compensation. The only thing I was given was a $25 credit for my next flight. No I am not kidding. $25! Not even a refund for the hotel they promised to pay for! I quite literally lost over a thousand dollars because of this flight and I do not have that kind of money. Absolutely the worst experience ever. I am so disappointed in American Airlines and would recommend that people fly with literally ANY other airline."
580,"✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines itself is a decent airline, but the fact that approx. 5 - 7% of their flights are direct flights is a capital crime. Almost every trip requires a connection, with about 85 - 90% of those connections being in Charlotte. It is kind of funny that lot of the budget airlines, like Spirit & Frontier among others offer a majority of direct travel all across Canada & The US. How is American Airlines not jumping on this. Honestly, a stopover is not bad, especially if you love flying, like I do. However with American, a stopover is a bittersweet thing. Firstly, a stopover could be anywhere 40 minutes to 1 hour. Hearing that you initially think ""OK, not bad at all"" then you have your first flight delayed for a bogus reason, rendering your connection pointless, which is frustrating. Frustration increases usually because with American Airlines, your first flight will be an evening flight, and after the delay, you get to your connection 1 hour late if not more, and you have to stay all night in the airport to get your connecting flight first thing in the morning. Yay! If you are lucky to get a representative at a ticket booth, which will be few & far between if that, you will be given some sort of miss-information in regards to why your flight was delayed. After finding out that upgrading my seat from aisle to window, would be $54, US as well. That's fun! American Airlines screws up and still wants to charge for trying to rectify the situation. Like us customer are the inconvenience. After saying no, I actually had a representative tell me ""You can certainly book a flight with United"" what kind of answer is that. Your airline messes up and your advice is have a customer pay more money with a different airline. Alright then! WiFi on American is not the best either, unless you are a Xfinity or Verizon member. If not, don't expect any internet access besides the American Airlines site allowing you to check other American Airlines flights to see your connecting flight is on time and knowing you will miss it. Prices for WiFi on the airline range from $15 - $20, just to use the WiFi on 1 device only. Oh Joy! I do realize airlines screw up sometimes, it's a part of travel. The whole ""it's about the journey, not the destination"" thing. However, at least have the decency to be honest with customers about what is going on and try to accommodate them. The very least you can do is try to keep the customer. At least with your own airline. As much as I love flying, a direct flight is certainly better than this headache I endured. American, please get your stuff together. Remember, you are not the only airline in the skies. Simply put, I almost missed a friend's wedding because of the American Airlines headache."
581,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight from OAJ was delayed by an hour due to bad weather (which is understandable) departed at 7pm, didn't get to CLT until 8:10 pm, CLT is huge and it takes like 15 minutes to get to my gate, causing me to miss my connecting flight to BWI at 8:28 pm. But I managed to arrive 2 minutes left at B9. However, I was notified that my gate changed to B12. It's 8:29, so I run over and now the door to my connecting flight is closed. Too late to board. Gate agent couldn't help me, so I was directed to AA Customer Service, which took 2 hours to wait in line. Waited in line, and on the phone for an hour. I couldn't get a flight change on the phone, luckily I was near the end and got told that my flight was actually delayed? But it literally left when I arrived. Then was told that I was checked in, meaning someone was checked in with my seat before I arrived late. That I paid for. Odd. Finally I got another flight which was delayed by an hour. It took 5 hours to get me home. This was my first AA mishap, and it was trying to say the least."
582,Not Verified |  Mellisa from American Airlines is the one who saved a summer vacation for her diligent and quick efforts to save our flight which was cancelled at the last minute. She’s the hero to 3 kids who will have a blast and will experience memories that will last a lifetime. That’s sometimes all it takes. Doing the part that we’re meant to do and doing it with heart. She was on the check in counter 7/20-2023 at 6am.
583,"✅ Trip Verified | My family's flight was canceled an hour before it was scheduled to take off. We were rerouted to an airport 90 minutes away from our final destination. At no point did American Airlines try to get us all the way home. They left us stranded at the airport with no way home other than to rent a car and pay out of pocket to drive home. When I asked for a reimbursement, they absolutely refused. They claimed they can't reimburse people based on weather cancelations. I told them this wasn't about the weather cancelation, it was about them stranding us at an airport 90 minutes away from our final destination and not reimbursing us for having to get ourselves all of the way home. I will never fly this airline again and, if you're smart, you won't either."
584,"✅ Trip Verified | First off, I paid for a first class ticket! A lot of money! I fly monthly and I always fly first class. When I got to the airport I went to scan my e-ticket which clearly showed I have a first class seat. The machine said I was too late to check luggage. It didn’t make sense. I was 2 hours early. A very nice woman helped me and she fixed it and checked my luggage. And I got my luggage tickets and my luggage was marked priority. When I went to check in at the gate I was told to step aside. A female agent said the ticket not in the system despite my having my boarding pass. So she asked a male agent to assist me. He was extremely mean and rude. He said I wasn’t on the flight. I showed him my confirmation email, my e-ticket that showed my seat number and he said it didn’t matter. I don’t exist in in the system. He then assigned me a new seat in economy. I told him I paid for a first class ticket. He said you didn’t tell me that. Ask for a refund. Had he actually looked at my ticket he would’ve seen that I was first class. I didn’t want to make scene so I moved on. When I passed through the first class cabin my seat was empty. I do not know if it filled after, but I was one of the last ones on the plane. I imagine it went empty. I probably should have just showed my e ticket and I could have sat down, but honestly I was so taken back by the way I was just treated I wasn’t thinking. I have sent an email to my travel agent to ask her how I can get a refund of the difference. I fly first class because I fly frequently and it helps me to me rested for important meetings. I spend a lot of my hard earned money. I was treated horribly by the agent at the gate. I do not tolerate that behavior and do not reward it with further business. I can tell you, I will absolutely never fly American Airlines ever again and I will never recommend them to any body ever again based on my experience on this particular trip. I don’t appreciate being treated so badly. There was no cause for him to be this way, other than he enjoyed pushing his weight around. So American Airlines, you lost a customer."
585,Not Verified |  First off I agree I could’ve better planned on my end. But I spent 10 hours at the airport to basically find my own solution. 3 visits to the customer service line and 2 phone calls before I decided this is ridiculous. My first flight out I missed by 5 mins even though I watched them give other stand by people my seat. There was a bad storm that delayed everyone. I was put on stand by 3 times before I’m like no this can not be the solution. My 3rd visit to customer service was met with limited reps and basically the last rep showing no empathy after I’ve been running around the entire airport for 7 hours just to get oh no the flight is overbooked. I ended up just purchasing a new ticket through JetBlue and let my anxiety not get the best of me. The reason I missed my flight is because pre-check took 40 mins to get through. No one had a sense of urgency. 10 people missed my flight so don’t you think that’s a big issue. I get it if it was only me but 10. The same people running from flight to flight. American wanted to wait on standby until the next day. I'm on a business trip for work there is no next business day. I'm just upset that it took so much time waiting to get no resolution and then me deciding to take my fate into my own hand where it got resolved. I will be calling American to get a travel credit after the amount they screwed me over. I’ll better plan my trip next time but American get better and treat your customers right. There was over 50 standby at one point. Y’all need to think of a better solution.
586,"Not Verified |  I don't often complain, however, I've noticed a trend with American Airlines always delayed, canceled or changes. I've purchased our tickets months ago only to be downgraded to a class that I've worked hard to pay for. I understand there are other customers in worse situations, however if it had only been a one time thing, I would've not bothered but I've tried a few more times after and have been completely disappointed. My fault for expecting to get what I pay for with this airline. This will most certainly be the last time we give our business to American Airlines. Disappointed."
587,✅ Trip Verified |  This was the worst experience I ever had at the airport. I missed my flight due to the negligence of the customer ice agent. When I complained about the service the agent was very disrespectful. I waited over an hour to see a manager. So I canceled my flight and booked with Delta. The experience with Delta was great. My company will never use this airline. 
588,"Not Verified | Trying to return home from our honeymoon and our first flight was delayed, but so was our second one from Charlotte to Cincinnati so we made it in time. While in line we heard them give my husbands seat to a passenger in front of us, when scanning our boarding passes they didn’t work, but our checked bags scanned? While in line for customer support (which was forever long) we were the next people in line and a worker pulled two groups to go to a gate worker to get the line down. We said no we wanted to stay, we were next in line. He told us we had to so another 2 hours later we are still in line at the gate and the gate worker had no clue what he was doing. So I went back and stood in line again at customer service. I made it to the front again before my husband moved so I called him to come back over. At the gate the worker would not look up where another customers bag was because they said over and over again that if you don’t make it on a flight neither does your bag. So at customer service we were very nice in which we did not get in return. Asked us why we didn’t know what flight we were on? Told us they rebooked us for 6 pm the next day. There were no hotels, no rental cars. So our only option was to stay at the airport for close to 20hrs. With no solution or compensation or anything. We then asked her if she could check where our bags were, in which she told us that if we didn’t get on the flight neither did our bags. We asked again if she could just check. So she did and was very annoyed about it and sure enough, our bags were on the flight without us. We asked how that happened, then another customer service representative said we have no idea you’re not talking to the right people about that? Who else would we talk to about that? Would not recommend flying this company to anyone."
589,Not Verified | This airline blows. Delay after delay after delay. All over a stewardess. Get me on a plane. I will never fly this thing again. Know so many people that work here but we’ve got delayed on all 4 of the flights and they lost our baggage going into Mexico. Absolute shame of a business for one of “the biggest and best”.
590,"Not Verified | American Airlines you no longer exist in my world. My parents 50th anniversary was a magical event! The Common Man Restaurant was amazing and Courtney was a delight but back to American Airlines. Cancelled my parents flight 15 minutes before it was due to leave! The call to customer service was awful they would not pass the call to a supervisor, nor would they compensate my parents for the serious issues they created. They were told this is a personal problem! The best they can do a flight Tuesday night! My parents car is in parking racking up the bill, their dogs are being boarded at a substantial cost, and the customer service person would not identify herself - she didn’t feel comfortable! As they say, no way to run an airline! American Airlines, way to ruin a wonderful occasion!"
591,"Not Verified |  Absolutely rubbish customer service. From beginning to end flight attendants were disinterested, rushed, unorganised and totally focused on doing as little as possible. Food was borderline inedible and unacceptable for a route of that length. Seat is uncomfortable and cramped. This airline should not be able to codeshare with other oneworld partners as they don’t even come close to their levels of service. I would never use them again."
592,"✅ Trip Verified | Overall, it was a terrible experience. My flight was originally scheduled for 10:40pm, but then it was delayed to midnight, a few minutes later it was delayed to 12:30, then 4:00am, and finally 7:30am. By the time we were made aware that the flight was going to leave in the morning, it no longer made logical sense to take a hotel voucher because by the time you would have made it to the hotel, you would have to leave an hour later to make it through TSA, so almost everyone on my flight decided to spend the night at the airport. In return, customer service representatives gave us $12 food vouchers. This is unacceptable. Not to mention, the customer service representatives were in a terrible mood and I do not blame them. They deserve better than having to tell a hundred angry customers back to back that all they can do is give a $12 food voucher. I am disappointed and will not be flying with American again. It is in your best interest to do the same."
593,Not Verified | This airline is poor when it comes to accountability for making people miss their flights I wouldn't ever suggest American for business trips or anything that you have a specific time to be there. We had to sit for 45 minutes for some unknown reason before we were able to get off which caused several people to miss their flights. I missed my flight and the only available flight for my destination is the following day in the evening so now I've lost an important client because the gates were closed and I wasn't allowed to board. American need to have all their employees communicate so things like this won't happen.
594,"✅ Trip Verified |  Let's start with the fact that we boarded the flight in Charlotte and then told the flight was canceled. No instructions on what to do. They gave our plane to the people going to Syracuse because their plane had mechanical problems. Finally I was told to go to airline services where the line was almost 100 yards long. I went to another terminal and they didn't have any flights to Albany, NY. Now I have to spend the night in the airport because they won't put me in a hotel for the night. Next flight is in the morning but I have to go to Washington DC and another 4 hour layover. While sitting here they boarded people onto a plane without interior lights only to make them get off again. Several flights had to switch gates so people are going every which way."
595,"✅ Trip Verified | Me and my wife landed in Dallas to connect with our plane to College Station. We were desperate to see our daughter who just got out of the hospital the day before. Because we were unable to deboard (gate not open?) we ran to the connecting gate (actually took the airport train) only to find out that they moved the gate. We took the train back and arrived to the now correct gate 8 minutes before take-off and were not allowed to get on our 4:50pm flight, We went to American customer service and were told the next flight was after 10 pm and that it had no seats left. Agent gave us two standby passes and said we would not know if we can get on unless two people sis not show up or cancelled and we would not know until 10 pm until the after 10 pm. I asked 'what do we do if we do not get on this plane?' Well we were told we can apply to get a hotel room. Mind you I am 70 years old and dog tired from being at the Nashville Airport for leg one of our journey at 8am that morning, We could wait until after 10pm if we knew we had a seat but not just to be told we were denied. We had to see our daughter! I took an Uber to College Station and the Uber driver drove us over an extra 100 miles to charge us more, which was not the original route or price. I am dealing with that. I called American to see if we could get reimbursed and was told that the I should of gotten on the 10:00 pm flight as there Were 5 SEATS! The agent lied to us! I am very disappointed at American and their shoddy customer service."
596,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was delayed on top of a 4 hour layover to the point where I missed my flight home and the next flight had to be the next time. That was after switching us from our first class ticket to economy, which means our plans for the evening meal were completely ruined. A 12 dollar meal voucher doesn't really cut it. Also, on the flight in the in flight meal sucked anyway. Like, some of the worst food I've been subjected to in a while. I'm never voluntarily flying American again in the future. All in all a horrible experience."
597,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines customer service sucks. While booking my tickets for 4 passengers (4 months before travel) and per baggage policy in American Airlines as well as in their codeshare, I had first free checked bag per passenger. I got the first free checked bag per passenger in my outbound flights. But then in the inbound flights, Qatar didn't allow a free checked bag. Qatar tells me “American re-issued the tickets on 5th Jul (just 4 days before the actual inbound travel) and removed free checked bag, and thus they had to charge me.” After multiple follow ups with American Airlines customer relations, they are not even ready to tell me why they did re-issue the tickets on 5th Jul (booking was done in Feb), and why did they remove free checked bag in the re-issued ticket on 5th Jul.  American Airlines is not even ready to deeply look into what went wrong in their system/process, and not ready to refund ($420 charged total for 4 checked in bags for 4 passengers). Absolutely 100% sure mistake of American Airlines, and still not willing to give it a serious consideration. I am done with American Airlines."
598,"Not Verified |  Every time I fly American Airlines there is always a delay. This time we sat on plane waiting to take off for 2 hrs. Missing our connecting flight in Dallas. This airline does not care about its passengers, they don’t care about safety or if you miss your flight e aisles of there technical issues. If one flight is late and there is a lot of people on the delayed flight for connecting flight, they should wait for the passenger.  Their service is low budget. They’re unorganized and unpredictable. Take your money to Delta or Southwest. Never flying with them again in my life. Ruined our Trip. Now we have to sleep in the airport. "
599,"✅ Trip Verified | My luggage had an air tag in it. I took a photo as it was being checked in. My luggage was checked through from Chiang Mai to JFK. When I arrived at JFK, one of my bags was missing so I filled out the paperwork. My air tag said that my suitcase was in Doha but the agent insisted that it was still in Bangkok. She refused to make note of this and was not interested in a photo of my luggage. So….time passed, I called again as my luggage was still in Doha after several days. She still insisted that it was in Bangkok. Then my luggage traveled to JFK, Terminal 8 — right next to Dunkin Donuts but… she still insisted that it was in Bangkok. If she opened her eyes, it was likely right in her office. After several more days, it traveled to Newark and she still insisted it was in Bangkok. This morning it arrived at the Syracuse airport and eventually at my home by FedEx. But, no one ever notified me that my luggage was found and that it was being delivered. American Airlines systems are broken and their personnel are poorly trained. Last year, they refused to let 25+ people board the plane in Doha because we were about 10 minutes late arriving but the plane did not depart for over 2 hours causing all of these people to be rebooked. American Airline is part of the problem instead of being part of the solution. Avoid flying with them whenever possible!"
600,"Not Verified |  I will never fly American again. Supposed to take off at 9 and here we are still sitting at 10.15. This is after we had to taxi all the way back to the gate because they forgot the log book. Kept us sitting for at least 30 minutes with no updates until we're told the pilots are over their flight hours and now we have to wait for another crew. Shouldn't that have been figured out ahead of time. Not to mention American took away mine and my husband's seats and made us pick new ones that we couldn't even sit together. The only explanation offered was maybe it was a flight swap. So like I said, never again will I fly this incompetent airline and will warning others to do the same. I understand things happen but this seems like major human error that could have been avoided instead of at the inconvenience of numerous passengers."
601,"Not Verified |  The customer service at the gate in Atlanta GA on flight AA 2591/02 going to Miami July 2nd around 1:00 was so horrible I don’t know how they have a job there. I have worked in customer service for 15 years and I have never in my life spoke to a customer in the manner this lady spoke to myself my husband and my two children. She was extremely rude and her comments were unnecessary. We were flying standby. Once boarding started, I walked to the counter to see if any standby tickets had been cleared. She said no. So I proceeded to step to the side and continue my phone call with Carnival cruise line to let them know we are arriving late. Not even 3 minutes later my family is calling my name for us to board. As we were gathering our belongings and walking up to the boarding gate she yells to me and my family, y’all moving pretty slow to be on standby, and says to me you was just up here asking if you were cleared but you taking your time. She made my 7 and 12 year old very uncomfortable when she made those remarks. It takes a lot to upset me but she pushed that button so quickly and doesn’t deserve her job with AA."
602,Not Verified | Very bad experience as usual. Delay in departing from Buffalo airport. The airplane was overweight so we have to wait for 2 passengers to give up their seats. Also arrived at Chicago airport and have to wait almost 2 hours to get off the airplane.
603,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew to DFW from Vancouver one way after attending a wedding. No delays on inbound flight. The flight was smooth with very little turbulence encountered. Kudos to American Airlines flight crew. They were polite and friendly. Premium Economy seat had enough legroom for a comfortable flight. Service is typical (biscotti, snack and soft drinks) of all domestic flights. American does a pretty good job of getting you were you want on their domestic and trans border flights."
604,✅ Trip Verified | American gave away aircraft twice and now no pilot! Incremental delays keep you chasing updates and gate changes. We are 4 hours in and still no hope. Spending 24 hrs to cross country. They will blame weather but they are giving aircraft to other routes. Most worthless customer service ever. Chatbot will provide platitudes
605,"Not Verified | My son's connecting flight got delayed by 2 hours not including the time he would already be layed over so I called and spoke to a man who was so helpful and very quick about it. I couldn't be happier with their services. Don't get me wrong, we always fly American as they have always been good to us but today went above and beyond to help us without any problems at all. Thank you American airlines."
606,"Not Verified |  AA's plane malfunctioned and caused a half-hour delay, causing us to miss our connector in Heathrow. They didn't communicate anything to us, and automatically rebooked us for a much later flight that night. They did nothing to reimburse us for our ruined first day of vacation, the missed reservations, and attempted to not even reimburse the food we had to get from the airport. They jerked us around for over a month before answering one of our complaints, and then toyed with us for over a month before blocking further communication with us. Do. Not. Fly. American."
607,"Not Verified |  This is the worst experience. I paid good money to have aisle seats and because our flight was canceled for no known reason, we were bumped to middle seats. I did not pick middle seats for a reason. I paid to have aisle seats and should gave had seats changed to the exact same choice. I doubt I will fly American again. This is the third time we have been screwed by American. "
608,"Not Verified |  Delayed 3 hours out of CVG, heard 3 different explanations of why, including a pilot shortage (from our pilot). Missed our layover in PHL because every American Airlines employee we spoke to refused to help us. Forced to spend the night in Philadelphia because the next plane wasn't until the morning. American Airlines refused to take responsibility for our missed flight so we had to pay for the hotel ourselves. Filed a complaint to the compensation department and they gave me a laughable $25 flight credit. I will never fly American Airlines again and I will be telling all my friends and family of my experience as well. When we asked for help making our connection, the only thing the desk agent said was ""American Airlines is aware of all connecting flights"" instead of offering any kind of help whatsoever. Missed the connection by 2 minutes because the gate was not held open or reopened for us even though the plane was still at the gate upon our arrival. Literally any assistance from anybody could have avoided this whole scenario."
609,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight with American Airlines (first time) as it offered a good price although the operating airlines were known for their bad service. But we decided to trust American Airlines. Well, after a sudden change of plans, I called the not-so-American airlines to cancel the tickets, and was ready for penalties, etc. ... but they offered me a 12 months credit. Ok, sounds nice, United airlines does it, Air France does it. But here is the trick: the 12 months countdown starts the day of the booking. As if it wasn't enough, each ticket will be credited separately, and only the name on that ticket credited can use the credit.  I will update my review when / If we use the credit they issued to each one of us, for the onboard service quality. Till then, American Airlines should live up to the name or fold."
610,"✅ Trip Verified |  AA 1289 was scheduled to depart JFK for BDA at 7:05 am on July 3. Some of the vacationers, many with small children, got up at 3am to catch this flight. We finally departed after 9 pm — after more than 14 hours, with no explanation, no apologies and no recompense. There were several aborted reschedulings in the interim. At one of them, the flight crew actually boarded, only to deplane 20 minutes later. They explained to the anxious crowd around the podium that there was a maintenance problem with the auxiliary power unit. So, during one of the busiest travel times of the year, at one of AA’s principal hubs, they didn’t have the wherewithal — parts and/or expertise — to make this repair. In other words, this terrible experience was 100% due to AA’s incompetence. Meanwhile, we got closer and closer in time to predicted, severe thunderstorms, raising the suspicion that AA was hoping nature would let them off the hook for canceling the flight. Finally, AA put us on substitute equipment, 3 hours after it arrived from CLT. I’ve been flying AA for 50 years and have 1.6 million miles. This was the worst customer service fiasco in that span."
611,"Not Verified |  I was originally booked to fly out on 7/7/23. I had paid for main cabin tickets, as well as for a seat with extra leg room, complementary alcohol, and a free checked bag (both ways). Within 24hrs I had to change my flight to the next day and was charged $57 for change in ticket price. The person I spoke with assured me the ticket change was equivalent with all the amenities I had purchased with the first ticket. At some point in time, American airlines changed my first flight to jet blue. When trying to check in for my flight tomorrow, I discovered that I was downgraded to coach and now have to pay again for extra leg room and I have to pay $30 to check a bag. Essentially I paid for something I am now not getting. This is simply unacceptable. I may never fly American again."
612,"Not Verified |  Worst flight experience to date. Flight kept getting moved all over then delay for 5 hours until they pushed it to the next morning. After that everyone had to stand in line for over 2 hours to get vouchers for a hotel and food, but the food voucher could barely afford a kids meal at the hotel. Hotel was the only option for food since all of the restaurants and shops were closed. Employees were yelling at customers who have been getting the run around for over 5 hours. No one answered any questions on how to use the vouchers nor did they do anything to speed along the process of giving out the vouchers. Ended up getting the run around for so long I just booked a different flight since they weren’t really doing anything to fix the issue aside from making everyone wait even longer for a vouchers that they hardly can use. Only customer service that gets made at you for you being upset and their bad service."
613,✅ Trip Verified |  The flight took off on time. Food was okay. Water and other cold beverages were offered several times during the flight. They also collected the trash couple of times after each service. Ice cream cup was served in the middle of the flight. Snack before arrival was so so. The seats are okay. On board entertainment - I had trouble finding something interesting to watch. This was return flight. To point out the food on outbound flight was horrible - especially the dinner- inedible mess.
614,✅ Trip Verified |  By far the worst airline in existence. Flights are constantly delayed and customer service is a joke! If you are reading this review. I beg you to learn from series of unfortunate events and avoid this airline at all cost
615,"✅ Trip Verified |  I purchased round-trip tickets for a vacation about 7 months in advance. Within three months, they had changed both my flight to the destination, and back home. The latter was a significant change, adding 5 hours of travel time (60% longer than originally planned) and disrupting plans both before and after the flight. I called to get a refund based on their cancellation of my original flight and putting me on an unsatisfactory alternative, and was told to file a particular form and I would get a refund on the original payment method within a couple weeks, so to just buy alternative flights that worked better. I followed these directions, but two weeks later, was told that my “refund” would be in flight credits, rather than the original payment method. This violates both their agent’s instructions AND Department of Transportation regulations. Yet, after multiple phone calls and email exchanges, I have been told that there is no possibility of receiving an actual refund. As I followed directions and immediately purchased new tickets, the flight credits are worthless to me — they essentially duped me into paying double for my tickets and are unwilling to do anything to resolve the situation. It has been a significant waste of my time, and I am furious at the lack of respect from their customer service team. I have no intention of flying American Airlines again."
616,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bad business practices on multiple levels. I have been corresponding for months with AA over a charge dispute that occurred when I called their 800#. I have emailed all the way to the C-suite, provided pages of back up and detail, and thought the issue was resolved. I have multiple communication with the representatives from AA that ""there was no charge"". Then, when my credit card bill arrives, surprise! There is a charge. So I politely contact them again and now all of the sudden I have to deal with a third party company and not them - ""it's not their problem"". Yet, I only ever contacted AA?? And they didn't know this 3 months ago? Bait and Switch or just poor service standards? As someone in the service industry, I have made it a point to be professional in behavior and in my communications. This is not a failure on the poor representatives they have contacting me. It's a failure at the C-suite level and that is a shame. This was an easy fix and they failed."
617,"✅ Trip Verified |  Total disrespect from staff at B7 around 11:45 p.m. July 2, 2023, who requires additional training on how to handle customers who are frustrated due to delayed flights (we were respectful and desired the same toward us) even customers that's upset and not respectful as a customer service rep no one/she don't / did not have the right to be disrespectful, get smart/sarcastic. We just wanted an additional room and I knew it was possible, as much money as American Airlines make. She also said due to our reservations was made together, this was the reason we were given only 1 room. She needs additional training or termination if this is repeated actions of hers which should not be tolerated in her field of service! AA did at least, after we were assisted by a nice manager named Liz and another gentleman that was with her, we did eventually received free taxi/ shuttle service to a nice Hilton Garden Inn facility, 2 nice clean rooms, a meal ticket (of only $12, but still was nice to receive) and we also was booked on another flight the next morning. "
618,Not Verified |  I have done multiple flights from different airlines in Economy class but have I experienced this discomfort knowing it's a 13+ hours duration. This aircraft is super duper hot. It's suffocating. No cool air at all that made us feel exhausted the whole flight. Better do something about it because your endangering the health of your passengers.
619,"✅ Trip Verified | Chicago O’Hare – Dallas Fort Worth return in Economy (Main cabin). Self Check-in in Chicago and Dallas were fast and efficient with helpful staff. Both flights were delayed, the first one 1.5 hours, the second one 20 minutes. Onboard experience was fine: FA's were friendly, cabin was clean and in a good condition. Seats in A321 were comfortable, but in 737 they felt much smaller when someone is sitting next to you. Inflight WIFI worked well with great entertainment options on your own device. There was also one free drink and snack service (cookies or pretzels) on each flight. I thought I had to pay for alcoholic drinks, but to my surprise I got a free beer. Overall I had two pleasant domestic flights except the delays."
620,"✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines canceled the flight my wife and I were scheduled on, we sat at the ORF airport for five plus hours waiting for it, delay after delay. We were informed it was canceled due to the incoming flight crew from New York being unable to continue on with our fight due to the delays it incurred. While there getting the bad news with everyone else, we overheard a lady mention that this was the third day in a row the same American Airlines flight had been canceled on her. Due to American Airlines inability to plan ahead and swap flight crews to enable us to fly later that evening when the plane did arrive, it caused us to have to cancel our vacation entirely. When we called American Airlines directly after we were told the flight was canceled, a representative told us they could not get us on another flight to our destination within the next few days. The customer service rep did slip up and say there was another flight with seats on it the next day but the seats were marked up to $4K each and he told us he could not put us on that fight! Due to American Airlines inability to plan ahead or get us on the next flight I was not able to see my Daughter who flew out of Houston to see us, my brother and his children or my Mom and Step-Dad all of whom I have not seen for over a year. I am in the Military and nothing is more disappointing than not getting to see my family the few times a year I can, especially when it's due to an airline company failing to uphold their end of a ticket purchase! Also, due to the last-minute flight cancelation, the non-refundable costs we incurred include; TWA hotel @JFK, our portion of the destination accommodations, and Airport parking for the day we waisted sitting there. My brother also flew American weeks before and had his flight canceled on him two times before he finally made it to his destination. The customer service was horrible when we were on the phone, they did nothing to assist us and were not able to answer most of the questions we had pertaining to our cancelled flight! My advice is don't fly American unless you are prepared to have a week of delays in getting to your destination, it appears this is quickly becoming their standard operating procedure."
621,"Not Verified |  Not just that the professional service was close to the worst. I chose This airline because of the service of the cheaper airlines, but was serviced in the worst way possible. It's also been two days and I have not yet received my luggage which is two days late. Think about this before booking your next flight with American Airlines, I know I won't."
622,"✅ Trip Verified | Delays are ridiculous, connections are tight, and care for the customer is non existent. I missed my connection because my flight was delayed. I was told 5 times at the first airport that my connecting time was still ""legal"" because it was more than 30 minutes but my flight didn't end up landing until 12 minutes before my connection departed. I made it to the gate before they finished letting on standby passengers but they had already given away my seat and refused to let me on the plane. Then at customer service, they couldn't get me out until late the next day but, since the delay was ""weather"" related, they refused to provide me with any hotel or meal vouchers. Then, at the gate to the next flight, they made me check my bag. Keep in mind that this bag had been fine on the last flight and all of my other flights this week. Now, I'm sitting here waiting for this flight to finally depart but we're delayed again due to maintenance. I'm beginning to wonder if I'm ever going to get home."
623,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our 1st flight was delayed, which led us to miss our connecting flight from JFK to London. We waited in the customer service line for about an hour and a half and were told that they had no flights for three days. They were also very rude to us. They did not offer any vouchers for food or accommodations (we did ask!) We were stuck in New York City with all kinds of things planned in Scotland. We called the customer service line and they were able to get us a flight the next day back to Phoenix and then to London. It took us three days to arrive to Scotland and we experienced a lot of stress and unhappiness, with absolutely no help from American Airlines. We missed a day and 1/2 of the trip we had planned for months. We also are out about $1,000 for incurred expenses. Upon returning home, I emailed to ask how to file a grievance, which is what the employee at JFK advised me to do. I have since heard from two people with no explanation of how to do this. The only thing that they sent is a $25 trip the credit for two of us. I’m completely insulted and flabbergasted by their lack of customer service and I will not be flying American Airlines again."
624,"✅ Trip Verified |  Many passengers on my flight missed their connecting flight due to delays. We were delayed at least 40 minutes taking off. Several passengers in front of me knew as we waited to taxi to the gate they had already missed their connection. The pilot and staff were great. The issue is simple to me. Flights that don't run within 15 min early/late run a huge risk of causing passengers to miss connections. The pilot was transparent in tell us they were assigned to a gate, which was occupied. Then assigned to another gate. Which was also occupied. So we waited on the ground about 20 minutes for an open gate. Don't airports have like 900 gates? I find it ludicrous that the delay was made even worse by the inability of the airport. Charlotte to find a gate. I have a layover, so I won't miss a flight. I guess this review is on behalf of my passengers missing connecting flights, the ludicrous flight connection system, and the entire system itself. I don't want excuses about pilot shortages, luggage handler shortages, import vibration, etc. For $550 for a flight from PA to AL, figure it out."
625,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely incompetent flight coordinator and grounds crew management! Last three times to Austin Airport, we sat on the tarmac for 30min waiting for a gate. Then we have to wait an hour + for our baggage claim"
626,Not Verified |  I really to thank you Deborah Martin from American Airlines LA for a great assistance she gave to a friend and I. We got out flight changed at the last minute while we was waiting to do the check in. It was changed for the next day and she fixed it putting us in the next flight getting to the destination at the same time. We really appreciate. Thank you again!
627,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst flight experience I’ve had in a very long time and I have had years where I flew over 50 flights. Missed connection coming in to DFW, misled by flight crew, no gate agents would speak to me, had to get in the only customer service line which was hours long, my luggage arrived nearly 24 hours after I did when I got to my final destination. Captain actually came back and asked us if we had seen anyone loading luggage and then shrugged. What a mess. Gate crews were rude and unconcerned. Will never fly American Airlines again."
628,"✅ Trip Verified | Twice, delayed flights, plans ruined because can't make connecting fought to destination. They don't give a damn. Done with them. Recommend you choose another carrier."
629,"Not Verified |  We flew from Jacksonville to Baltimore. Flight was delayed and I had to make another flight. We stayed at airport over nine hours. Now we are trying to fly back home to Jacksonville and this flight is delayed. Never again will fly such an incompetent airline. So trying to cancel trip in Sept, ticket is non refundable"
630,"Not Verified |  Terrible. My family and I were forced to check our bags even though there was plenty of room in the overhead compartments for our carry ons, and our carry ons were within the size limit for the compartments. Once at the baggage claim, all of our bags eventually came out except for mine. We headed into the customer relations office to ask if they knew where my bag was, and the woman’s response was, “We’ve been waiting for you to come in here.” They then proceeded to show me that my bag had been completely shredded, and several items inside had been shredded as well. It was very obvious that they were not planning on going out of their way to show me my damaged bag or make up for the damages. I’m very disappointed with the customer service and the lack of awareness in today’s world. I will not be flying with American again."
631,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience ever. Flight delayed then cancelled. Offered hotel voucher but one person for a line as big an aircraft capacity. Five people were helped in 2 hours. Then we got cards that says we're closed and she left. Voucher for food was $12. A hamburger is $25. Doesn't matter, they were all closed. Then delay to another gate to delayed again. We had the plane from last night. They said we could leave are bags on board. So we have a plane with no crew or pilot. Every AA employee was pretty rude and wouldn't do anything for you. I'm cancelling my AA credit card because I don't want to use American airlines ever again."
632,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight 703 CLT to BUF was diverted to PIT on Sunday, 25 June 2023, for valid reasons. Stuff happens. Vouchers were given for a hotel and for food. A voucher was promised for travel to hotels that did not have a shuttle service. The travel confirmation texted to my phone contained a link to american-airlines-passengers.tvlinc.com/. The page to which the link led provided a registration code for the hotel and a voucher for $12 for food. In the middle of the page, it said, ""No shuttle: Transport voucher will be available after hotel is booked."" No vouchers were given at the gate in the airport. No voucher was given by the hotel. No voucher appeared in my American Airlines app. No voucher was offered today as I checked back in for the flight to BUF. We were told that all we had to do was to contact aa.com/refunds to file a claim for the travel to and from the hotel. 1. There is no option on aa.com/refunds to ask for transportation to and from the hotel. 2. A link in the support page asks whether the user would like to chat with support, but the page to which the link leads has no portal to a chat system. I do not think American Airlines is competent enough to be lying. They just do not know what they are doing. Stuff happens, but some stuff that happens is contemptible. I pass over the hour wait in PIT for a storage container to be delivered to the pantry. That is a whole other level of incompetence that just added ire to the fire."
633,"Not Verified | Our mission trip to Africa was cancelled due to travel in vain. The airline failed to get us to our destination, it is as simple as that. There were 23 of us traveling together, all leaving from Albuquerque. Our American Airlines connection in Dallas was delayed so we missed our connecting Qatar flight which then spiralled into a nightmare of trying to get our flights rebooked for 48 hours. We were told that our tickets were booked and that our luggage would only go where our tickets specify (by multiple agents from Qatar and American) only to find out when we went to check in that our flights had not been rebooked, and later that our luggage was not remotely attached to our tickets (but halfway around the country or world without us). The nightmare we went through trying to get American and Qatar to talk to each other to make sure our flights were actually booked was an unacceptable fiasco that no paying customer should ever have to go through. We went back and forth between the two counters dozens of times only to find out each time that their systems would not work with each other. This ultimately ended in our trip having to be cancelled because the airlines could not get all 23 passengers on a flight to our destination before the gate closed. The lack of efficiency was only second to the lack of care and empathy on the Airline's part. The customer service we experienced from American throughout this process was abysmal- agents literally laughed at a hopeless mother of six who had been stranded for two days because of their system's incompetence. We did everything in our power to ensure that we were working within the system requirements, being diligent to double or triple check things (even though that is not our job) and get to the airport 5-6 hours early to be safe. None of it mattered. In the end the Airlines failed miserably to treat us like respected customers or even with basic human decency. Because of this disaster and being stuck in Dallas for nearly 72 hours we incurred thousands of dollars in expenses (hotel rooms, Uber rides, food deliveries). We hold American responsible for this nightmare, though Qatar played their part as well. If they had not closed the gate on 23 people 30 seconds before we walked up to the gate (and refused to reopen it) none of this would have ever happened. But it did happen, and now we need to be reimbursed for this horrific disaster. "
634,"Not Verified |  This is by far the worst flying experience I’ve ever had the displeasure of experiencing. The staff were unhelpful, rude, and just gave wrong directions, our gate changed a total of five times and looping back to our original gate, it took two hours to even get a crew on board the plane, and when we were finally seated and ready to go, they had to refuel the plane! Our flight was supposed to leave at 4 pm, but it left at 9:20pm. I never wish to fly with this horrible airline for as long as I live. Awful experience."
635,"✅ Trip Verified |  They failed to take off on time resulting in being late to the next 2 flights, then they had the audacity to tell my wife the she will be stuck in Charlotte for the night and they will not be providing a room for her because the flight was delayed due to weather issues. The only reason i even bought the tickets where because it was last minute and there were no other options."
636,"Not Verified |  Good service generally but three major complaints. Because Limited business class space, had to fly economy. After two legs in business class (Johannesburg, Dubai, Miami) this represented huge challenges with luggage, which cost a fortune. Did nobody foresee this disconnect? Loyalty program is a total con - none of benefits (priority boarding, first bag free) materialized. So why bother? Blatant profiling at boarding, clearly rules apply only to certain passengers"
637,"✅ Trip Verified |  As someone who travels frequently, this was the first time I encountered a staff that didn't know how to smile or appear willing to help. This issue was not limited to a single staff member; the next desk had the same attitude. Since this was a work trip, my colleagues also had the same impression about the whole crew. It's not just about their lack of willingness to work; it's also the attitude that made me feel like I was doing something wrong or that I was an unvalued person who didn't deserve good service. I was not going to write a review but they forced me to do this with things that happened afterward. My bag has not arrived with me. Their staff assured me that my bag would be sent directly to Porto. Trusting their words, I didn't even think about tracking my bag during my 5-hour layover in Lisbon. Why would I? I have learned that my baggage was not even checked into Lisbon airport. Consequently, when I arrived in Porto, I had to wait a long time for my bag. I notified the lost bag department and missed my paid train home. I was exhausted and disappointed, not knowing what to do without my presentation materials. They called me whoever I was talking to (Stacey) was the only good thing about this airline. She was nice. I spent around 60 euros because of them. (paid ticket, presentation materials, clothes etc.) However, the other airline companies I know generally pay compensation right away. Here, they are asking you to fill out a form to claim your money.  It is well designed for you to give up and not be able to fill out the form to claim your money. In any way, the time I lost, the frustration I had for a couple of days. These were all enough for me to never ever use this company. This was my first experience with American Airlines, and I am sorry that it turned out this way."
638,"✅ Trip Verified |  Wishes I could give it a zero. I had to make a connection in Dallas from New Orleans to San Diego but the first flight was delayed so I had to change the second flight to the latest one. The first flight was delayed 3 times until suddenly we’re informed it’s cancelled. The app automatically canceled my second flight so I had to rebook both. I eventually could take another flight to Dallas (which was delayed too) while the last flight to San Diego was still boarding (delayed by an hour as well). However since my flight (with a reserved seat) was cancelled and no seat available, I had to stay at the airport. There’s a long long line waiting at the customer assistance and the line was almost not moving in more than an hou. The staff appeared not caring and helpful, not sure what they’re doing behind the computers. Will never book their flights again."
639,"Not Verified | Miami airport is the worst I've seen. Few charging stations, delayed flights a million times, canceled flights with very little staff to help rebook. Nasty restrooms and changed gates a million times. You have to walk for miles for each gate. After changing my gate and flights a few times, they sent my suitcase to Tampa Florida which was my original connecting flight to get Dallas. It was supposed to me 3 hours and ended up having to go to Las Vegas to Dallas for 8 hours with my 10 year old. She was exhausted and so was I. We got home at 8 with no bag until 10. I slept for 1 hour and had to go back to get suitcase. "
640,✅ Trip Verified |  Use another airline. This airline is horrible and don’t help at all. My flight was scheduled for June 21st to departure at 1:14pm to arrive in Dallas at 4:49pm to connecting flight to MCO. I spent all day in the airport from 10 something in the morning until 5ish when they decided to stop delaying it and just canceling it. I spoke to two different reps with American Airlines and one said it was a maintenance issue that caused the delayed another one said there was no crew availability. They think that because they arranged accommodations and meal vouchers would be okay! No that’s not okay! Who is going to pay me for all of us who had to work and I have school. It’s a total of 6 including a minor. The agent at MLM moved our flight for 9:30am the next morning just to find out later last night it had been moved to 4:47pm. This is ridiculous every agent or rep I speak with do absolutely nothing! They blame the airport and the airport blame Dallas airport. This has been a total nightmare. This will be the last time I ever use them. Oh and to top it off they sent me an email giving me a $50 trip credit! You think that’s okay? NWho’s going to pay our day missed at work the extra days at the parking garage for our vehicle? American Airlines don’t care!
641,"Not Verified |  American Airlines had an almost 14 hour delay because of mechanical issues that they knew about the night before the flight. Despite this, after waiting 7 hours at the airport, I booked another flight as I had to be at my destination the same day. It cost almost double to fly on another airline. Instead of compensating me for the extra expense, American has offered only $25 in credit, less than $1 per hour of my delay. I have never experienced terrible customer service like this before. Be aware that if there are issues, American will leave you high and dry."
642,Not Verified |  I just had my worst experience ever flying courtesy of American Airlines. I booked a round-trip and I lost a day stranded in the airport to go to my destination because American Airlines delayed my flight and now I'm stranded in Miami until Wednesday because American Airlines just canceled my Monday flight at the last minute and they just left me to my luck.
643,"Not Verified |  I usually fly American, however this is the 3rd time my flight has been delayed. In a row, causing me to miss my connecting flights, all 3 times. Then, I was rebooked on flights the next day. Unacceptable, especially when I'm on a tight schedule. I'll be changing airlines for future flights until things get back up to standard."
644,Not Verified |  Picture this: your flight is delayed for a reroute flight plan but eventually takes off 30 mins later only to land 3 hours later at an unscheduled airport causing you and your wheelchair assist family to miss an international connecting flight and now you are stranded. You cannot rebook your flight using the app as it still says “delayed” 3 hours later. You are directed to call an speak to an agent which is a 3.5 hour long wait while your connecting flight has already landed! You are not offered even a beverage. You cannot receive your luggage in order drive to the next airport. And your family cannot receive any updates from the staff who are now mutes. But you have paid upfront all of the required fees and taxes for every single facet of these flights. And somehow the courtesy of communication was not included in that cost. Take your business elsewhere. It would be easier to just walk.
645,"✅ Trip Verified | I recently had a highly disappointing experience with American Airlines' code share partnership with Japan Airlines. As a loyal customer, I had accumulated over 300,000 American Airlines points, but their redemption process left much to be desired. Despite having a substantial number of points, I was unable to use them effectively or receive the benefits I expected. One of the most frustrating aspects of my journey was no seat selection options, particularly when traveling with children. It is unfathomable that an airline of American Airlines' stature would not prioritize the comfort and convenience of families. With no control over seat assignments, we were left scrambling to find suitable seats, causing unnecessary stress and discomfort. Adding to my disappointment, there were no options to upgrade, even when I was willing to pay for an upgrade. This lack of flexibility was particularly disheartening considering the length of my journey. Traveling from the USA to Vietnam with a layover in Japan for over 9 hours meant that comfort and quality service were crucial. Unfortunately, American Airlines/Japan Airline failed to deliver on these fronts. To make matters worse, the return trip mirrored the same problems. The absence of reliable customer support was particularly frustrating. There was no one to turn to for assistance or to address our concerns. This lack of accountability and communication left me feeling abandoned and unsupported throughout my entire journey. Furthermore, both of my flights experienced delays during boarding. This additional inconvenience only served to exacerbate an already frustrating experience, leaving me questioning the airline's commitment to punctuality and customer satisfaction. In light of this disappointing experience, I am left wondering about the value of retaining my American Airlines points or why anyone would choose to remain loyal to the airline. The inability to utilize my points effectively and the overall lack of customer-centric services have seriously diminished my trust in American Airlines. I sincerely hope that American Airlines takes these concerns seriously and addresses the numerous issues faced by their passengers. Until they demonstrate significant improvements in their services and customer support, it is difficult to recommend them or have faith in their loyalty program. Please note that this review reflects my personal experience, and others may have had different encounters. However, based on my own journey, I would caution potential travelers to consider these factors before booking a flight with American Airlines or their code share partner, Japan Airlines."
646,"✅ Trip Verified |  American has quite simply taken the throne as the worst airline imaginable. Where do I even start? We board in Phoenix, AZ in June when it is 110 degrees outside and the plane is a literal sauna. Apparently the ac “wasn’t connected”. We then sit on the tarmac for an extra 25-30 minutes sweating profusely in the most uncomfortable situation. In the air, the outstandingly horrible display of an airline continued. I paid $40 for Wifi for the flight to watch the Us open golf tournament and in the least surprising news of the century - the wifi was broken for more than 75% of the flight. The cherry on top was the flight attendants ridiculous behavior. When asking for garbage I handed the man my sprite can and the cup. He only grabbed the can and the cup spilled on a passenger at the end of the row. They are having an exclusive discount on a Mastercard for 70,000 miles? What a joke. The attendants were loud on the speaker talking for at least 20 minutes trying to push this deal before the end of the month. Grand finale? They had interns on the flight deck at JFK and they moved the plane to far forward. We sat at the gate for 45 minutes before being able to get off the plane at 12 in the morning. If you offered me free flights for life on American I would say “no thank you” disgusting display of professionalism- worst airline imaginable. Should definitely take your business elsewhere"
647,"Not Verified |  My family and I came from a long 12 hour long flight from overseas, which was also American Airlines (went smoothly) and when we landed in Dallas it was supposed to be a short 2 hour layover before heading to Austin. Turns out the flight kept getting delayed and delayed over and over again whether it was technical issues or due to not having a pilot to operate the plane. Originally was going to depart at 6:00 pm, was now delayed to 11:50 pm. Unbelievable. Service was mediocre at best, but overall extremely chaotic and unorganized and it would have been better to have put my money in a more competent airline. We have stayed at the airport for over 7+ hours. Please put your money in a better airline, just because it’s cheap doesn’t necessarily mean it’s worth it."
648,Not Verified | This morning my grandmother and aunt’s digital boarding pass did not match the terminal listed on the app. The employee at DFW was rude and would not even tell my aunt if she was in the right terminal until she went back to the car to get my grandmother with a wheelchair and giant bag to check and no assistance at all. It was extremely difficult and stressful for them and they were treated with disdain. He talked to them like they were ignorant and an inconvenience. I literally cannot express how disgusted I am with the poor customer service and lack of empathy or decency that was experienced. I hope I can always find a flight on another airline and avoid yours forever.
649,"Not Verified |  
Chaotic. Flight was first delayed an hour then the plane had broken down so we had to move planes and after being sat on the plane there was another 4 hour delay. This is very unprofessional and unorganized. This airline is terrible please never book a ticket to this airline."
650,Not Verified |  They pushed our flight back 5 hours with no explanation and simply just a text! You definitely should spend the extra money on a better airline if possible. The staff are friendly but just overall a very unorganized airline. Do not recommend putting yourself through this chaos. No partial refund or sorry for the inconvenience. Will never fly this airline by choice again.
651,✅ Trip Verified |  Beware - you will be treated very badly if your ever have to make a claim against this company for poor service. It makes no difference of how long you have been flying with them. Customer Service leaves a lot to be desired - following rules without any empathy or understanding of stress caused to passengers on delayed of cancelled flights. I would recommend you use another airline. My complaint was escalated but was returned to Customer Service!
652,✅ Trip Verified | This is the last time I spend any money with this airline. My flight was delayed almost 4 hours! The ticket agent was rude. My wheelchair never arrived at gate. I mean this place is lousy. If you must travel Avoid American Airlines at all cost. I think I'll stick with Delta Air Lines.
653,"Not Verified | Just know that even if you book months in advance you are only buying the opportunity to fly stand by. I attempted to print out a boarding pass after checking in and their app said that could not give be a boarding pass via the app and that I should go to the ticket counter, at least 200 people in line. I finally got my pass but could not run fast enough to make the flight. I am 72. I am now sitting for 4 hours for the next flight that I may or may not get a seat in. I am feeling abused."
654,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chaotic. Everything with them is chaotic from ticketing to arrival. Checking in is chaotic, dropping off bags chaotic. They change gates, seats, sometimes arrive early others late. From crew to ticketing agents, all rude. My flight just got confused and landed in Dulles instead of DCA.  So 1 hour late."
655,"Not Verified |  The worst flying experience I’ve had so far. Currently writing this in the airport at 10pm after traveling since 5am so far. Delays due to weather I understand. My first flight was delayed two hours and even though I got to my connecting flight before the schedule departure time, the plane had already left. They said that we weren’t even scheduled on that flight even though we were. Their system had automatically rescheduled me without my approval because they “thought we wouldn’t make it”. When trying to get a new flight with the AA agent, she was huffing and puffing like she was annoyed with us as we were trying to find the best flight that would work for us. When we got to our second flight, there was a ground delay for another two hours. However, one of the hours was due to miscommunication with the airport staff and even though we had been ready to leave for an hour, we were waiting on staff to direct the plane who had no idea that we were ready. On my final flight to my destination there was another 45 minute delay. When the boarding time came, staff had announced that there will be another delay but they could not give us an estimated departure or arrival time. They did not even give us an explanation as to why, however another passenger later found out it was due to the crew members never arriving and no one was able to contact them. the tickets weren’t cheap and it has ended up being a waste of my money and time."
656,"Not Verified |  Made reservations in advance, but on the day of my flight it was cancelled 3 hours before boarding. Once a reliable airline. Now it is not worth even contemplating booking a reservation with a non-productive airline. It is like going into a grocery store and finding no food on the shelves. Worthless business."
657,✅ Trip Verified | My flight was changed 4 times! American Airlines delayed my outgoing flight 3 times without considering the time it takes to get to the gate of the connecting flight. The 1st 2 times it was cancelled I did not get an email from customer service with the new flights.
658,"Not Verified | Every experience with this airline is terrible, but this was an especially bad experience. As usual, the dirty, cramped cabins are uncomfortable but expensive. The flight was delayed due to over-booking flights in Denver. They claimed weather, something entirely not backed up by their own flight tracker and the National Weather Service. Naturally, this is making me miss my connecting flight. I will gladly never fly this airline again. They are simply the worst airline."
659,"Not Verified |  American Airlines is one of the worst companies I have had experiences with that I’ve ever had. They delayed my flight to Europe, causing me to miss my connecting flight. I am understanding that things happen sometimes but the way they handled it was unacceptable. I was traveling with my entire family and small child and they totally displaced us causing a domino effect of chaos for our travels to a foreign country that we have planned for 10 years. It was very unprofessional way that they handled the situation, and they were just dumped me off to the next supervisor who would then dump me off to another supervisor. You’re unwilling to give me any type of compensation for the chaos that they created and that’s just unreasonable in my opinion and unprofessional in business. If you and your family like getting treated like trash, then I would highly recommend them but if you don’t, I would run for the hills."
660,Not Verified | Delayed my connecting flight and then filled my seat even though I had a seat purchased and arrived before departure. These thieves overbook then pass the problems to customers.
661,"Not Verified | I’ve flown AA twice in 2023 and each time they have delayed my flight. There is always a connecting flight from Houston to Dallas so my connecting flight is always missed due to delay in Houston. Today, June 15, 2023, I had scheduled a 800am flight connecting to DFW which was delayed to 1000am. I was notified at 357 am of delay by text. When I get to airport the representative tells me the 800am left on time. She is not sure why they changed my flight to 1000am. I do - they bumped me off my flight. So my connecting flight in DFW will be missed because I arrive at 1140am and my connecting flight leaves at 1047 am. The DFW flight I paid for a seat which means nothing to AA. Now I’m on standby in Dallas waiting to see if I get on a 500pm or 900pm flight. AA so conveniently change your flight regardless of the fact you PAID for your flight and seat! In 2022, I was bumped off a flight 5 times in one day. AA doesn’t care."
662,"Not Verified |  My family and I traveled from TPA to FCO via DFW (outbound) and PHL (return). Overall, AA provided a solid travel experience. The flights were on time, our checked baggage arrived without delay, the service on the ground and in flight was professional and courteous. The seats were typical for a US-based carrier's economy product. The IFE had many choices and was easy to navigate (though, my one complaint here is a lack of appealing music choices; I was looking for classic rock and/or 1960s and 70s pop (Beatles, Stones, Journey, Styx, Wings, ELO, etc.) and their selections included songs and artists I've never heard of). The catering was good; biscoff cookies on the domestic segments and a full meal and snacks on the trans-Atlantic segments. AA offered a choice of 2 meals on both international segments. Along with the entree, the meal tray includes a bottle of cold water, a small salad with an olive oil-based dressing, a roll with butter, crackers and cheese, and a brownie for dessert. Overall the main meals were satisfying. Especially enjoyable was the main meal on the FCO-PHL segment; it was a chicken dish with mashed potatoes and vegetables and was one of the most delicious Y meals that I've had in 46 years of travel! I will not hesitate to fly with AA again."
663,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew to Boston from DFW one way. No delays on outbound flight. The flight was very smooth with very little turbulence encountered. Kudos to the flight crew - very polite and friendly. Kudos to American Airlines. The premium economy seat had plenty of legroom. Service is typical (biscotti, snack and soft drinks) of all domestic flights. ICE worked just fine. American does a pretty good job of getting you were you want on their domestic flights."
664,"Not Verified | All aspects of our trip were fine with the exception of one - checked baggage. Our flight 2846 on June 13 had a delay of less than 15 minutes, with all staff members along the way being professional, until we retrieved our 2 checked bags. 1 bag lost its name tag, which is no big deal; however, the other bag looked as if it was assaulted by a baggage handler. Both wheels were missing, and looked as if they were torn off by a jungle predator, with clothing falling from the ripped corners. Additionally, the top handle was torn off. So the bag had to be picked up and carried flat with 2 hands. We showed the severely damaged bag to the clearly miserable airline baggage agent who replied, “Sorry, but all claims must be filed online”. Of course when going online to file the claim the policy states that reports first need to be filed at the airport. Bottom line - would definitely not check a bag again if flying American into San Francisco."
665,"Not Verified | The worst flight experience I've ever had, waiting nearly 2 hours for the pilot to show up another 2 hours after landing to park the plane. Flight was for 9pm I didn't get off the plane until after 130am. It was a 1 hour flight."
666,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolute nightmare of a trip, we are first delayed 5 hrs in 30 minute increments with various reasons for the delay. Then when they cancel the flight at 130, they push it 24 hrs and won't but people on the earlier flight leaving the next day. Give us hotel vouchers that are in Brooklyn, a 40 min drive, and when you call the taxi on the voucher they say 1-2 hour wait because there not ready for 200 people at the same time. So I show up the next day 24 hours later and another hour delay because the plane isn't ready."
667,"Not Verified | Experience was terrible! Flight delayed with NO notice 24 plus hours, no whereabouts on bags and provided $12 DOLLARS for food for a whole day. DISGRACED to say the least. Food also terrible and minimum leg room. We’re only provided a hotel room 100 plus kms away with no transport. Got stuck in LAX with no clothes, belonging etc and were stranded. So thank you so much American Airlines for your APPALLING service!"
668,"✅ Trip Verified |  Nice flight all around. It was an award travel ticket. I was originally supposed to travel to White Plains, but asked if I could go to LGA because of bad weather and delays and they agreed."
669,"✅ Trip Verified |  We planned and paid for our multi-city trip in March 2023. Two months later when we checked American Airlines app, they had changed all our flights and seats. They never contacted us by any method to tell us of these changes. Sadly, that was just the beginning. We spent hours on the phone to get a reasonable facsimile of the flights and seats we had originally booked, although we were put in different boarding ""groups"" even though we booked and paid for seats together in the same rows. We had booked our flights 4 months before the trip and still were always in one of the last groups to board. The days we flew there were just more and more problems: flights delayed over an hour with no explanation, multiple gate changes for several flights (including terminal changes as well), their app would randomly display the wrong boarding pass or boarding gate/terminal, we had to have our bags checked at the counter where we were boarding because there was never enough room in the overhead compartments, except on one flight, after they made us check our bags, we discovered there were at least 3 empty overhead bins as well as bags already in the bins that were clearly oversized, and fortunately we had packed lots of snacks since even on a 4 hour flight over the noon hour, all they offered was pretzels or a cookie...unless of course you wanted to buy some other snacks they offered."
670,"✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible airline with terrible policies and terrible explanation of their policies. We paid $2200+ for flights to St Thomas which we had to cancel due to Covid. We were told at the time we cancelled that we would have 1 full year from the date we cancelled to rebook new flights for our credit. We tried to rebook using our voucher within that time frame and were told for the first time that we needed to have used our credit to rebook and actually travel within one year of the date of the original ticket purchase, which was 2 months ago. What if we (like many) had purchased our tickets even further out for our international trip? AA never explained this policy to us and now we are out $2200 and their response was “we’re sorry, we will try and do better next time.” Ridiculous response from a company that just effective stole our money. Book at your own risk."
671,"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and I have been treated so awful this flight as well as all the other passengers on this flight! First, they kept delaying the flight in Dallas to take off to Sacramento California for 6 hours because they didn’t have a pilot when we where in Sacramento waiting for that plane to take us to Dallas airport. Then when we call the airport terminal for our shuttle for the hotel that we needed to get because we couldn’t make our connecting flight the people were so rude. I was literally in tears hoping we could make our shuttle in time (if you ever been to the Dallas International Airport you would be overwhelmed too) Then we get up at 4:00 AM to get to our new flight to head to Tulsa and it’s been delayedagain. I’ve already had to call my job and tell them sorry I couldn’t make it to work today and so did my husband. Oh and they didn’t want to give us a voucher or anything. The lady at the front desk so I am fine and don’t need anything - the same thing happened on Christmas Eve when we where boarded our plane and they took our pilot away so we had to sit and wait for 7 hours! This has been the worst experience  I have ever had American Airlines"
672,✅ Trip Verified |  I travel a lot and this was the first time on American Airlines and probably the last. Worst experience ever! First flight out of Buffalo NY was missed because of their counter woman taking over an hour with another customer and only one person at the counter. Several people misses their flights due to her. Lucky the phone customer service was able to get me on a flight with JetBlue however when I purchased my flight with American it included one bag I had to pay for my bags on JetBlue! On the return flights the on the ground customer service was horrible. I was directed to the one counter lady because she was the one that spoke English however she refused to help me because she said and I quote “ I do not speak to Americans” and the other person that didnt speak English clearly over charges me for my second bag the connecting flight from Miami to Charlotte NC seem to go smooth but once I reached Charlotte it went downhill once again. I had to spend the night at the airport for my next flight back home to Buffalo which I was aware of however when booking this trip AA assured me I would be able to comfortably rest at the gate for the evening. That was not the case and I understand they have no control of the facility but no where to stretch out other than the floor which again I have no problem with but it was freezing and I am now extremely sick probably pneumonia. I asked one of the AA clerks if they had a blanket or anything to help keep me warm as everything within the airport was closed and could not attempt to purchase one she was very rude and couldn’t be bothered. One would think of you are going to strand your customers over night at the terminal you would be a little more accommodating at keeping them comfortable. After all the cost of flights are not cheap. I am extremely disappointed in the customer service on the ground the only real complaint with the inflight was the crew from Cartagena to Miami never told us what carousal the luggage was coming out at and that was stressful as I had a connecting flight and had to go through customs with my luggage and that takes time so wasting a half hour trying to find out where it was was unacceptable. I guess you live and learn I most likely will never travel on American Airlines again.
673,Not Verified | Absolutely awful. I will never ever fly American again. Canceled our flight at the boarding time. Instead of letting us rebook on a United flight insisted we had to take American and travel 2 days to get back with kids and no luggage since it was checked. Staff was so rude and absolutely unhelpful or caring. Worst most miserable experience ever.
674,"Not Verified |  This is the worst experience ever! Please get another airline if you don't want to be frustrated. This airline is so far the worst flight I have ever been to, customer service is bad, their employees have a bad attitude and are rude most of the time. The seats are a completely nightmare, if you travel for long hours you'll end up with neck and back pain because their chairs are so straight up forward. Really bad experience, never flying with them again!"
675,"Not Verified |  American Airlines travel is always the worst experience every time I travel. From the check-in counter to the arrival gate and everything in between, I get unprofessional interaction with AA personnel. The COS front counter today was a total fail (on an extremely slow day). Delay after Delay after delay. This is the experience every time I travel from COS to DFW. Should've driven back to Denver and traveled with Delta. Keep thinking they will get their act together, but not yet. Chances that arrive at my final destination today or slim and none. With the prices AA charges for flights, you'd think they would get some aspect of the travel experience correct. Such a disappointment."
676,✅ Trip Verified | Overbooked the flights and then mechanical issues delayed the flight. Instead of cancelling the flight and putting us up in a hotel they just keep delaying and delaying. Two days in a row one of the flights to Columbia was cancelled or delayed due to mechanical issues.
677,"Not Verified |  Flown with them 3 times. Every time I flown with them planes are always delayed or canceled. Worse customer service I ever had. You can never talk to anyone, when you do you just get transfered to someone else. Lost my baggage when I made a claim just kept getting transfered to someone else via email. Asked to talk to a supervisor, they said they couldn't help me. Worse Airline ever."
678,"✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely unprofessional. Flight to Buffalo was delayed and moved gates multiple times. At gate D2 a flight to Austin delayed the flight to Buffalo due to staffing issues as Buffalo was supposed to arrive at D2. Gate was switched AGAIN. Buffalo was announced to be delayed due to staffing issues as well. Then after all the delays, it was postponed overnight due to weather. Weather would not have been an issue if it wasn't delayed so many times due to other issues. No accommodations, but the flight to Austin received them, the flight that influenced OUR flight. AA staff then proceeded to tell ALL of us, that we heard the announcement wrong. Although our flight was delayed due to other flight staffing issues, we received NO accommodations. The staff then proceeded to be nasty to us and give us attitude for calling out AA that the flight would have departed before weather had it not been for other delays. They acted extremely unprofessional and nasty. Then I had walked by the staff mocking and laughing at the frustrated Buffalo flyers. So all of us heard the announcement wrong? Seems to me like AA lies to the face of their customers and doesn't want to dish out more cash for their mistakes. I can only hope somebody recorded the interaction and makes it go viral. I personally spent money on a blanket and pillow so to be somewhat comfortable sacrificing my health and sleep for AA's mistakes."
679,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the fourth time I have flown with American Airlines. Each time it is something different. Either the plane needs maintenance or they don’t have the pilots at the terminal yet, or they have to recalculate the route and get more fuel. It’s very frustrating as a repeat customer to never reach my destination in time. I have meeting that I have to reschedule or family has to wait for hours at the airport waiting for me to land. American Airlines you should be ashamed and pay me back for the inconvenience you have caused for the last four of my trips"
680,Not Verified |  My daughter is 11 and flew by her self for the first time today. American Airlines have been super accommodating and very supportive when making sure she is being released into our listed contact! Calling to make sure they were there or going to be there to pick her up. Allowing both my husband and my step mom through security to take her / meet her at the gate. Making the first time flight for her very special and successful.
681,"Not Verified |  This has been a horrible experience from the start. I arrived at the airport 5 hours before my flight. After waiting in line for almost 2 hours, when I got to the counter to check my bag I was told they just closed checking bags for my flight. I called and rebooked. Thankfully, I was rebooked quickly. However, I am now on the flight and the door to the plane won’t latch. I have been here for hours and no answers. My son recently passed away and I was trying to get away for some peace. This has added to my already stressful life. I am so upset. I will miss out on at least one day of my vacation. I won’t fly American again."
682,"✅ Trip Verified |  An airline that was excellent has become a horrible, and inconsiderate attention when there is one. My daughter is stranded in Miami without notice of cancellation for 12 hours at the airport with no one to come forward or come up with a solution to the issue. really embarrassing. At least one explanation, a hotel where to sleep, they are treating customers like garbage. No one does that. AA the worst in airlines. I don't recommend it at all."
683,"✅ Trip Verified |  Words can't even begin to describe how abysmal this service is. Time and time again, I've flown with them because they were the cheapest options, and time and time again, some awful thing has happened because of it. For anyone reading, spend the extra money on another airline. Trust me, it's worth it as to not experience with the frustration of dealing with this terrible airline. During my flight, they delayed the initial one, and when we landed, there was a jetbridge issue that prevented us from catching our layover, leaving us stranded while someone else we were supposed to board with flew alone. When we tried to explain this to the attendant at front, she rudely denied us and said we weren't allowed on even though the door was still open. Had to run to get more tickets and was luckily able to get on the next flight, but only because I sprinted across the airport to do so. There are plenty more stories of how this airline has wronged me: delays, misplaced luggage, failure to assist, etc. Had a broken foot once during a flight and was denied for help. Got delayed so many times that I missed a family funeral. Had my luggage sent to a different airport. I say this again, whatever money you think you're saving by flying with this atrocious service, you're simply aging yourself 10 years with the stress you'll accrue. And chances are, you'll be wasting more money fixing the mistakes American Airlines caused."
684,"Not Verified |  I have had a progressively painful and weakening issue with my hands to the point that I had to move states to live with family as I am unable to drive, cook, clean, or work anymore. On a good day I am allowed to lift 5lbs, but most days it's much less than that. I had to fly from TN to MI for my last post-surgical appointment and no one from the airlines actually offered help or how to get help, each person just told me to go to someone else, all while toting my luggage which was way out of my weight range. When I voiced concerns and (once again) the reason I need assistance, they straight up told me to ask other passengers for help instead of offering any real solutions. I have never felt so stranded and frustrated. I have flown a good amount in my life and I'm generally ok with giving up quality for price but I will never fly American Airlines again and I will discourage others from doing so. They made me feel like such a hassle and offered no help. Not everyone is able-bodied, and that doesn't always look like wheelchairs."
685,"Not Verified |  So our flight from DIA was delayed by 30 minutes to Dallas Fort Worth. We where supposed to get a connection at 10:43 pm but since our flight was delayed we missed that connecting flight which was the last flight out of Dallas Fort Worth. So guess what we had to stay all night long until the next day/morning. The service rep said because our delay was due to weather we basically get nothing! Just stuck all night and we had a graduation to go too that day, it really put us behind schedule and I will never fly with this airline again!"
686,"✅ Trip Verified |  Arrived at airport to find a 2 hour delay which is going to make us miss our connecting flight from Chicago. So they rebooked us so we now fly from Indianapolis to Chicago to Washington then to Hartford. Not landing till after 11pm, gonna have to pay another day for parking and pay my house sitter. Guess no picnics for memorial day."
687,"Not Verified |  I will never fly again on AA. A 2 hour delay taking off in Vegas and losing even more time in the air, resulted in a missed connection home on another AA flight (to which I was charged money to get a seat assigned during check in and it wasn't refunded to this date), that not only didn't wait a few minutes but nothing was taken care while still in the air in order to put me in the last same day flight available to Europe. I missed a wedding the next day because of this. And in order to be home 2 days later, I had to take care of everything after landing, with people that had no idea what happened. And in this experience I also learned that AA seems to overbook most of their flights, resulting in several clients being left behind and no room to accommodate clients like me that lose connections because of AA. Horrible company!"
688,"✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for reservation of 4 seats. (Made reservation, same seats for return flight, for personal reason child). On boarding passes we got these. But on the plane we were told to take place on other seats. Even before we saw that our seats were occupied. Purser adviced us to ask for refund. Result: rejected. Maybe because our boarding pass was correct. And because of the 200 characters, you cannot explain correct. Conclusion: mislead. Never use American Airlines again. Because they did not solve the problem. Mailed to customer service with attachments. But they cannot overrule decisions. Offered a trip credit for next flight. But that is not how it should be."
689,"Not Verified |  Arrived with plenty of time to spare for a flight that was supposed to depart at 11:56am. Over the course of the next 7 hours the flight was delayed multiple times. They never gave any reason for their delays, and many people ended up needing to switch flights or find other plans. Horrible communication and planning on their part."
690,✅ Trip Verified |  I will never recommend American Airlines! I was in the airport since 0630 on time for 0730 boarding to New York and connect to Minneapolis. However my flight cancelled and rescheduled twice which made me miss my work. I was supposed to be at work in Minneapolis at 1930. I planned my flight giving plenty of time to myself. I was hopeful to get home after 7 hr to the the latest for my night shift. All I did is seat from airport to another airport and suffer all day Monday. I finally flew from DC to Charlotte at 1:55 pm and landed around 3pm. Only option I was given is to wait till 10:56 pm flight to land at 12:37 am for extra expenses. Stop by to the customer service and asked if I can get meal voucher which took her about 30 min and even being accused for verbally threatening for her because I asked her information/I’d. she told me connecting plane was on time and told me that is my fault for not being in the right place and “we only offer one meal voucher per day” what? Ironically it was not under my control for the airlines canceling my planned flight several times a day. I have to say that I got $12 meal voucher in DC airport for the morning and she finally gave me $12 for lunch. I also have to be punished at work for calling in for 8hr night shift and lose my sick time/money for me. I am very disappointed for the whole process and end up being physically/mentally/ emotionally and financially to be drained and my time is taken away from my family. I filled a complaint online and I was rewarded 2500 mile for 11 hours of delay from my original ticket and 11 hrs of hustle and bustle - what a joke.
691,"Not Verified |  Another horrible day traveling with AA. Staff has been nice but flight was delayed for 6 hours. Then once we finally got on the plane, AC didn’t work while we sat at the gate another 24 minutes. I am still sitting on the plane waiting to back away from the gate. This has been another major American Airlines blunder."
692,Not Verified |  Flight 2414 was scheduled to leave Dulles at 5:09 pm. We all boarded the plane and were ready to depart when the grounds crew reported a stick in the wing. We waited 10 - 15 minutes and then we were told we had to deplane because there was a bird's nest in the wing that would take 1 - 2 hours to clean out. One hour later groups 1 - 3 boarded the plane again and then we were all told that Dallas  Fort Worth had grounded all flights because of weather. I flight then let 3.5 hours late at about 8:36 pm. Upon arriving in Dallas my connecting flight had already left the airport and there were no other flights. This resulted in my wife and I having to pay for a Lyft because all the shuttles had ended at 10:30 pm. Then we had to pay for a hotel because American insisted that our flight was delayed because of the weather. I reported all of this to American Airlines customer service but they continued to insist the delay was because of weather and even if there was a bird's nest that would also be something out of the airlines control. Sorry but this is garbage. I have been a loyal American Airlines customer for years but they have devolved into an airline that does not care about their passengers. I will be using my air miles up and never fly American Airlines.
693,"✅ Trip Verified |  So on the morning of May 22, my wife and I were leaving for our honeymoon and after checking in they told us upstairs that our bags were fine to be carry on. After getting to the desk to board a young lady had the nastiest attitude towards us that was uncalled for. Seeing as though we are the paying customer like everyone else, if she didn’t want to work today she could’ve just stayed home. She wouldn’t give us her name so another worker stepped in to help us get on board and just checked our bags in. She stated whoever downstairs didn’t do their job if they let y’all up here with those bags. My reply was maybe it’s you not doin yours and being extra today waking up on the wrong side of the bed. Nonetheless never would we ride this airline again."
694,✅ Trip Verified |  On his trip I flew AA multiple times. Every time the flight was delayed. Monday 22 May flight 2577 PDX to DFW delayed 2 hours. Had to change to United to get to Richmond. Wednesday 2384 delayed to Charlotte. Then next flight 1848 to PDX is delayed. This is crazy. Every AA flight I have been on this week has been delayed. Never again will I book American.
695,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recommend no one ever fly with this airline if you want a smooth trip. If your looking for people who can help escort you in the right direction when your lost, who will handle your bags with care and who are kind and considerate of the passengers then this is not the airline you want to use. The employees are rude. When I asked for directions to get to my gate they had no idea how to point me in the right direction. When I checked in my suitcase it was in healthy condition with all four wheels when my first flight was over I went to retrieve my suitcase and it was damaged with a missing wheel. I went and complained to the American airline desk I was told they didn’t have another suitcase to give me and I filled out a claim and was then told I would have to buy another suitcase and take a picture of the receipt to upload it to a site then I would be refunded.  On May 23,2023 I returned to catch my departure flight I checked in my suitcase and me and my boys got on a flight. We froze the entire flight it had to be 69 degrees or lower. At baggage claim My suitcase case was ripped open with all of my items coming out. I went to the desk and the lady tried to act as if I overstuffed the suitcase but the zipper was not split. They then told me I could dump everything out in my car and they would repair my suitcase but it would take up to twelve weeks to get back. I was so upset because it seem they tried to come up with every reason not to fix my suitcase I just turned around and walked off. "
696,"Not Verified | I flew from Charlotte to Nashville. On my way back from Nashville, my flight was delayed which turned into cancelation with no explanation as to why. I'm diabetic and had no more medication because I thought I would be back in Charlotte to take it that day. There was one couple in front of me trying to get home for work the next day like a lot of other people on the plane including myself. They were able to get a standby flight but I was told I couldn't even though it was dangerous to me not to have my medication. I thought it was unfair. I missed work and was sick. My situation could have resulted in hospitalization or worse without my medication. I later sent an email for a refund or compensation for what I went through that day and night and they offered me $50. I emailed back saying that was not acceptable. I spent $250 on the ticket and thought they can do better then that. An agent then reached out and called saying since my flight was canceled I could have asked for the refund at the airport and got on another flight with another airline but there's nothing they can do now. If they would have offered me that option when this was happening I definitely would have took it. This was my first time in a long time flying with American and had a horrible experience. There were a few passengers that complained about their experiences with American in the past. Do not fly with this airline. There are better airlines out there. They may be a bit more expensive but worth it not to have this happen to you and probably would compensate or refund to make up for what people go through and to keep a customer happy."
697,"✅ Trip Verified |  Even though our flight from Heathrow to Dallas was canceled, we were sent an email saying that the flight was canceled, we didn’t know which part of our flight trip, the only way to contact them was to call them in the United States. Oh and by the way when you try to book a ticket it lets you get to the final stage and then because Cyprus is one of the two countries which are not on the list of options it won’t let you complete the purchase which was of course a hassle because we had to call the UK office in order to have this fixed. Our bags are supposed to go straight from larnaka to Monroe as this was a flight booked through American Airlines all the way but it turned out that we had to pick up our bags and then recheck in up our bags from  Monroe if you wanted them to be with us. The staff on the plane were loud, rude, seemed annoyed and bored. We were seated at the very end of the plane, one seat before the end, reason being we weren’t able to check in online because our flight has been canceled and we had been redirected to another flight. The food options kept running out and we were offered the same options all the time. They never took into consideration that we are traveling with a child and that the children should be served first. We practically froze to death, kept asking for an extra blanket since our blanket had got wet they seemed annoyed and rude . When we told them we were really cold they said to us that we were close to the coolers and that was the reason. Worst experience of my life never traveling with American Airlines again."
698,"Not Verified |  When I arrived in Houston, I was sent an email stating that my Bag did not make it on the plane with me. It stated that my Bag would be delivered to me within 4 hours. This was on Saturday, May 20 at 12pm. It is now Sunday, May 21st at 7:21. I was given a website to click on, which I did. I completed the form within 30 minutes. I put the address where I would be staying while visiting my son. I kept checking the website which informed me that my Bag would be delivered on Saturday. It was not. On Sunday morning at 9:30, the website stated my Bag was picked up at 8:23am and would definitely be delivered by 6pm. It was not. I have medication in my bag that is supposed to be taken daily. I don't have any clothes or personal items. I have searched and searched for a phone number to call or an email to send, so I could notify customer service of my predicament. I could not find any way to message someone, only mire forms to complete. I have been in Galveston which I stated on the first form I sent. Tomorrow, I will be returning to Houston and will be going to the Airport to talk to a real person who can hopefully help me. I will never fly American Airlines again. I can understand that things happen, but not communicating with me or providing me with a way to communicate with a live person is inexcusable."
699,"Not Verified |  My experience with American airlines was ridiculously horrible. Although it may be not the first time I flew on that plane but this will be my last. I have never seen someone delay their flight and then telling us that the plane arrived although the pilot left and doesn’t want to fly the plane. Then telling us that they are looking for a captain, officer, and pilot for them to be able to travel after delaying from 8:35 pm till 12:15 am. Finally when they all arrive we board the plane waiting inside for almost an hour telling us they are waiting for two passengers and then comes the captain telling us that he feels fatigue and he feels that it’s not safe for him to fly so they rescheduled our plane till 10 am in the morning. They did give us a hotel, although thinking about it the hotel is outside the airport in Chicago as well as we had to come back very early the next day so if we would have relaxed a bit it would be only about a few hours. Most of us passengers stayed at the airport waiting till 10 am and not just that but they changed our gate number 6 times that morning and we were just running around the airport finding our gate. Very bad airline."
700,"Not Verified |  Got to the airport 3 hrs early, stood in line over three hrs just to be told they couldn't get us another flight for 4 days, give us a number to call for refund because Delta could get us there the same day. Now we'll wait another 10 days for our refund from American. Do yourself a favor and book Delta first."
701,"✅ Trip Verified |  The absolute worst airline in existence. My family and I took a trip to California for the first time, the flight there connected to Charlotte wasn’t too bad, although it was delayed both times. The flight back was terrible. First flight to Charlotte was delayed. We finally get on the plane and it’s cutting it way too close to our departure time for the connecting flight. We sprinted to the gate and made it to minutes before the departure time and it said the flight was closed. Several other people from my flight were also there and missed the flight. It was American Airline’s fault in the first place that we were delayed and they had no care in the world for the connecting flight. No talk of accommodations, refunds, or anything. Next flight isn’t until 9am the next morning from Charlotte to Richmond, meaning we would have to stay overnight in the airport. Worst airline ever, do not recommend as they do NOT care about their customers and do not accommodate or help out even when it’s their fault."
702,✅ Trip Verified |  I had my flight from Dallas to New york on 18th May. After 2 hours of layover I had my connecting flight from NY to Doha. We boarded the flight and after 30 mins it was announced flight is broken so it’s canceled. We all waited for almost an hour to get an update if we are getting another flight. We were told to go to a different gate. Now after 2 hours they started checking our passport because the new flight we got was smaller than previous and they couldn’t accommodate everyone. Few of the passengers didn’t get the seat. At 1:00am they told us flight is rescheduled to afternoon 1:00pm and we will provide you accommodation and only $12 for food. We all didn’t have dinner because of all the delaying and they just gave $12. It took them a whole lot of time to provide hotel details to everyone and I reached my hotel at 3am and hungry. Next day we got transportation provided but it came so late that we reached the airport just 2 hours before the boarding time. Now after reaching the airport passengers for doha were in a separate queue where only 2 counters were open and all others were in a queue with 8-9 counters open. Now with 1 hour remaining to check in they said we cannot check in because you are late and it’s just 1 hour for the flight. After arguing with the manager somehow they let us check in and go to the flight. But again we are here sitting inside for 2 hours and delaying further more. Worst customer service experience ever. Flight get delayed/canceled but this is not how you provide customer service. All the staff were rude and unaccomodating.
703,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a 40-year American Airlines AAdvantage Frequent Flyer who has watched the sad deterioration in service over the years. First, they failed to get our Las Vegas/ Philly flight to Philly in time to make the connection to Lisbon and then stuck us in a cockroach-infested motel in a bad neighborhood because we had to wait a full 24 hours for the next flight to Lisbon. I did request an alternate booking on any airline and was rudely rebuffed. We got a $12 voucher for breakfast, nothing for lunch or dinner. They also changed our return flight from a two hour layover in Philly to a 5.5 hour layover. I asked for an Admiral’s Club day pass to make the layover more bearable and they blew me off. They also failed to credit me for the loss of preferred seating when they stuck us in inferior seats on the Philly/Lisbon segment. I did notify them by email of the problems and only got a boilerplate reply saying “read your Conditions of Carriage” over two weeks later!"
704,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airline. I took a break from them and here they are yet again very disappointing, delay every flight I had today. And waiting for another plane to unboard so that those people could catch this plane is beyond ridiculous. Waiting over 45 min for other passengers to board.  We should not have to suffer for other people. Will never use this airline again ."
705,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight from Holguin-Cuba to Miami on May 5th scheduled for departure at 1:30pm. (AA 2726) I got to the check-in station at 11:35pm with only a carry-on and there was nobody there. I was told by the front desk lady that the fight was already closed and I had lost the flight. She sent me to the American Airlines office at the airport. At the office, the AA representative told me that ""the plane was already closed because passengers have to be at the check in point 3hrs before departure"". I was about one and a half hours talking to these AA reps at the airport while the plane was still there and they didn't want to check me in. Same thing happened to more than 10 passengers. This is just insane. Happen that the Cuban dictatorship have a charter plane for this same itinerary scheduled for departure three hours and a half later, and they offer you to buy a ticket for this second plane as an alternative for you to fly on the same day. My wife and myself had to buy this other flight ticket for $518.00 in order to get home that last night. I just called customer service on May 6th at at 4:00pm and the representative told me that he doesn't know what happened, but he recommends to be at the check-in point 3hrs before the flight. I requested to talk to a supervisor and the supervisor told me that I am supposed to be 2hrs sharp before the flight at the check-in point and I have to file the complaint online instead to talk to customer service. They will only give credit to fly again only from Cuba. Very disappointing."
706,"✅ Trip Verified |  Despite the fact that when buying tickets 3 months before the date of travel, me and my wife chose our seats, 24 hours before departure American Airlines separated us and then moved us to completely different seats. Our seats were offered to another couple travelling without children or other dependents. Why? There is no logical explanation. I tried to get help online but it was some ridiculous joke. I made a complaint and the response is also just fixed formulas without any explanation or assurance for the future. Travelling with the spouse separately because AA had such a whim! Whether such practices are the norm in AA, I do not know, but it is probably too much of a risk to choose this carrier again."
707,Not Verified |  The worst. First they messed up on my departure had me down to drive 2 hrs & a half to the Chicago Airport when I told them I wanted the Moline Airport since I'm closer to that one so it cost me an extra $400 to change it even though they messed it up to begin with then we were right in back of the first class people from Chicago going to San Juan & had to watch them being pampered to death with all the attention while we got none plus big meals while we got stuck having to choose off the very limited menu & eat a little snack box filled with junk food. Super cold on the plane especially flying back & they had no blankets to give out one of the female stewardesses from the Moline departure looked like she hated her job she just sat there the whole time & looked bored & miserable don't know what her problem was but wasn't too friendly. The female stewardess from San Juan flying into Chicago looked high strung & filled with anxiety that it made me feel uncomfortable. I will never fly American again & wouldn't recommend it to anyone it's expensive & you don't get what you paid for including healthy foods off the menu just a very limited one with processed chips & store bought cookies or a blanket if you're cold. 
708,"Not Verified |  This is ridiculous, I get a round trip ticket from Tul to Dallas to Bakersfield. I was supposed to leave Dallas at 10:30 pm then we get a delay that’s fine stuff happens sometimes, but every time i’d check on the flight the continue to delay the flight. 2 am comes along and we got a plane but we don’t have a pilot, so they decided to cancel the flight. I stay the night in the terrible seats expecting to leave at 10:30 am, but they continued to delay the flight and change the gates repeatedly. Every time I asked for help or for an update on what’s going on they don’t give me an actual answer. I don’t recommend taking their flights if they are gonna treat their customers like that."
709,"✅ Trip Verified |  First time flying with American Airlines and the last! Our flight out of Albuquerque was late, but we boarded an hour late and thought we would make our connecting flight. We sat for another hour in the plane and were told there was a cabin light that was not working and did not need to be fixed to fly, but the pilot chose to hold the plane up anyway. We had to run to our connecting gate at DFW. Our luggage did not get on the plane. When we got to Key West, a baggage claim employee told us we would probably not get our bags until the 4:30 flight the next day. We just questioned why as there was two earlier flights. She apparently did not like being questioned and just gave us our baggage tickets back and said there was nothing else she could do. We were getting married the next day and all our wedding attire was in those bags! We called the airline customer service the next morning and found out she never filed a baggage claim ticket tracking either and were told the bags would be on the 1:20 flight from Miami. When we went to the airport to get the bags, the baggage claim supervisor had taken our bags off the carousel, came into the terminal, called our names and we were instructed to go talk to him at the baggage claim window. He told us that Tracy had indicated we were intoxicated and using foul language when speaking to her the day before. Both of those statements were a lie. Unless American Airlines over serves their customers, there is no way we were drunk. We were on their planes from 9 am until 4:30 pm with no layovers. Secondly, my fiance does not swear, just ridiculous! He told us we had two options, either apologize to the staff or he would send our luggage with a delivery service and we would get it sometime that day. We told him we were getting married in a few hours and our wedding attire was in those bags. He said he understood, but those were our options. So he held our luggage hostage and basically forced us to apologize to the staff for something that never happened, just so we could get our luggage and get married. I would like to know where our apology is from American for ruining our entire wedding day! I cried all night and most of the next morning because we thought we were going to have to cancel our wedding. I had so much anxiety that by the time we did get our luggage, the wedding was hard to enjoy. Thank you for altering what should have been one of the happiest days of our life, getting no apology from you and acting like your airline was the victim!"
710,"✅ Trip Verified |  I will never fly with them again. I was the last to enter the flight so they decided to take my cabin bag as a checked bag, they damaged it and then they claimed it was previously damaged before and refused to write a luggage claim for me. My worst ever flight experience. The guy at their SFO airport office was extremely rude and he accused me that I accidentally damaged my bag to make them pay. What a disgrace!"
711,"Not Verified |  I have flown with 8 different airlines and out of all of them American Airlines is the absolute worst. I will not be booking with them in the future even if it saves money. Out of my 6 flights on American, they have never taken off or landed on time. They do not keep their members updated. The plane is very outdated, uncomfortable, and seems unsanitary. They have no entertainment although free WiFi is advertised, it never works and even their complimentary snacks and drinks are lacking. I am currently sitting on my flight and have been at the gate for 2 hours without any updates on the estimated time of arrival. "
712,"Not Verified |  Horrible customer service. I was flying with my 5 month old baby on mother’s day via American Airlines. While boarding the plane, I asked a crew member if he could help me place my carry on in the over head compartment since I was carrying my baby. He told me to ask someone around me for help, if I’m not mistaken, aren’t the flight attendants there to help make flying easier for the customer? I was shocked. Won’t be flying American again."
713,"Not Verified |  I will not fly American Airlines again. I purchased 3 seats and understood the seats could not be refunded. An emergency kept my daughter from flying with me. I was ok because it meant that we would be able to have a whole row to relax and share. Not only did American Airlines seat someone in my third seat but it was a huge, foul-smelling man. So, instead of enjoying my flight, I was squished and had to smell a man for 2 hours who’d obviously not washed. I am absolutely incensed by this."
714,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our outgoing flight was delayed three times and then actually boarded later than the last delayed sent by message. We got on board hoping to have a beverage, but the cabin lights were turned off and no stewards showed up during entire flight. The heat in the cabin was excessively hot. On our return flight, we took the Airbus to our designed gate for our connecting flight at DFW. The gate was changed - back on the airbus to a new gate, another delayed flight, another gate change. I was disappointed in AA."
715,"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible customer service from the American airline employee that checks your tickets as you board the plane. This was the rudest encounter I have ever had at an airport. I will never fly American again. I paid a lot of money for my family’s plane tickets, to be treated like that. They should be training their employees to not treat people so poorly."
716,"✅ Trip Verified | I am going to avoid flying American from now on and will even pay more on another airline because every person I speak to gives different information. I was told we could fly standby, then we can only buy one way tickets and at the same time they are telling my son and I that no seats are available so no standby or purchase yet they have a standby list. American seems to not care at all about the consumer and is not transparent at all."
717,"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible Customer service, and just a horrible airline to fly. The staff don’t help and they won’t let you switch flights even when they aren’t full, or when you have to pay extra. Do not fly American."
718,"Not Verified |  Worst customer service ever, unpleasant employees and just paid to make customers day awful. Never flying with them and never recommending them. Add to this the usual delays. "
719,✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline I have ever flown with. Would not recommend anyone to fly with American Airlines. Our flight has been delayed 3 times and when we finally boarded 24 hours after our original flight they made us get off the plane as one of the crew members was on a different flight that hasn’t even arrived yet and we got delayed by another 2 hours. Also the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. Will never fly with American Airlines again.
720,"✅ Trip Verified |  I asked the flight attendant why the Exit row was empty. And if we can move some passengers there, in case of an emergency, she denied and said those were more expensive seats. (What means than profit in more important than security for this company."
721,"Not Verified | Very annoying experience. It all started, when the airline got delayed. Have connecting international flight. In this case, a big problem. When needed the most, customer care fails to resolve. It's like passenger is on their own to find out a solution."
722,"✅ Trip Verified |  Plane was delayed on arrival. In flight WiFi had horrible connection and was non-existent. To top it off, our plane landed at 4:06pm and we remained on the runway for another 50 minutes. Still not off the plane, but I hope I can be soon. Terrible experience."
723,"Not Verified | So I fly a lot with AA and achieved their highest frequent flyer level, this isn't about my status but the frequency that I fly. I'm currently sitting on a flight waiting to depart CLT and again no announcements or apologies. In fact quite the opposite. I board with group 1 and the flight attendant is telling everybody to hurry up because it's not the airlines fault it's late. So who's fault is it? I was at the gate on time, previous flight was delayed leaving and gate was occupied, so what about the gate next door? It was open the whole time. It gets worse every single week, the delays the bad attitudes, the lack of professionalism, the indifference to all the passengers. Now I really feel like a number and not a person. AA was never great but it was at par with Delta, now there is a vast difference between the two, no wonder Delta is ranked #2 and AA #9. I'm about finished with AA for good, because AA just doesn't care as long as they get their $$$!"
724,✅ Trip Verified | For a short flight that’s around 2 hours. I’ve never would had thought the service of AA was pretty much the same as flight with Spirit. If I knew of the service I’ll be getting today. I could had booked with Spirit and saved $400 in the different of price that you would receive from Spirit. This airline service has gone down since Covid for sure. I’m pretty disappointed with this flight and service today.
725,"Not Verified | Our flight was delayed leaving Atlanta due to ""construction"" which is what we were told. There were multiple AA flights delayed and none of the staff would hold the gates although we were arriving only a few minutes late. We had to stand in line for customer service for over an hour. We were basically told that we would have to take the new flight that was assigned which would have us getting to our destination 10hrs later with 3 stops. When I looked on line they actually had a flight leaving an hour later with no stops. We were not offered that flight nor were we offered to be on standby. When asked if AA would accommodate us with a hotel to leave the next morning with no stops, we were told no although the policy clearly states that you all would do so. When asked about the delay compensation policy, were were told that it did not exist although it is clearly found online. Customer service was terrible. I have been flying with American for many years, including for work. I am highly disappointed that we were not accommodated or compensated in any way for the huge inconvenience."
726,"✅ Trip Verified |  Was travelling from LAX to MCO as part of a Multi city trip from the UK. I was travelling with my wife and we had 2 check in baggages between us. One weighed 27kg and the other was 19kg. That's a total of 46kg which was our allowance (23kg each). It was fine from LHR to JFK and JFK to LAX. But when we were checking them in at LAX, the agent thought she knew better than anyone else. We were initially surprised by how she was talking to her own staff at the check in counters. rude is an understatement. She then told us that it is a maximum of 23kg in each bag. We had to open our bags again and move some stuff from one bag to the other. I wonder what Kacy or American Airlines achieved by making us move stuff between our own bags? The agent is a disgrace to the airline as she doesn't know how to speak to her own colleagues let alone customers. "
727,Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst. The flight was delayed. Then kept getting delayed so bad that I would miss my connecting flight. I had to get new flights so late and work the next day. Then they forced me to put my carryon as a checked bag which ended up getting lost because they put the wrong persons name on it. Now they have to ship it to me and I fly out again in 2 days and need that bag. I wouldn’t complain but this happens every time with them. I
728,✅ Trip Verified |  This airline is absolutely terrible. I would not recommend them at all. They constantly delay flights due to their poor software systems. Avoid at all cost.
729,"✅ Trip Verified |  I wasn’t planning on reviewing but I read so many bad ones it seemed right to write about a good experience. Both flights were fine. There are such low expectations now but everything went fairly smoothly. I feel for the solo flight attendants working the entire cabin without assistance trying hard to be of good service. On both flights they hustled their way through drinks and a meal offering bread, top offs etc as swiftly and kindly as possible. Considering what they are given to work with I was impressed. Apparently cost cutting leaves the employees and passengers on the short end of the stick. Nevertheless both attendants did their best and smiled through it all."
730,"✅ Trip Verified |  We were delayed 4 times for a total of 1.5 hours. We got to the gate to board and they told us there was no more room for our carry on so we were required to check it. We got no reimbursement for our inconvenience. We flew round trip. And here we sit ready to board again and the plane isn't even here. It's being delayed again. For the 2nd time this time around. I will never fly with American again. At the very least, they could have given us priority boarding on the way back. "
731,"Not Verified |  Worst customer service! Flight delayed due to weather. Next flight out was 20 hours. Would not reimburse hotel or food “since it was an air traffic control, not mechanical”. Went to ask about my stand by at gate agent. “That’s not my flight so I can’t help you”. Will tell and share with EVERYONE not to fly American."
732,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines are the worst I have ever dealt with. Due to their fault I am stuck at JFK airport for 9 hours (which has now taken my journey time to around 24 hours). No one wants to help. I was offered a meal voucher for $24 dollars, a bottle of water at this airport is more than $5. It’s actually laughable. I asked if I could use the lounge so I could be more comfortable, not an option apparently. I asked if I could be upgraded so that I might have a chance to sleep on the plane, not available. So they have left me here to sit in an uncomfortable airport chair for 9 hours with about enough meal vouchers to get an overpriced bottle of water and a sandwich. AA are a joke and they do not care about their customers. "
733,✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible customer service. Every flight required that passengers gate check their carry on. Why tell you one person and one carry on if every flight has the carry on checked? This left me hurrying to remove batteries and valuables from my carry on before the flight. All much more difficult to get seat assigned over other airlines. I have to get seats at my connecting airport. Will not fly them again.
734,"✅ Trip Verified |  My first flight and I have no complaints. I lost my ID on the plane somehow, and they were kind enough to mail it to me. I was pleased with my experience."
735,"✅ Trip Verified |  What a worthless airline. Wife and I were supposed to fly from Seattle Friday night and land in Paris Saturday afternoon. Our Viking excursions included a Saturday/Sunday hotel with two walking excursions starting Sunday at 9:00am. An hour before our flight we were informed of a two hour delay, then we found out we were going to New York. When we got to New York they were going to put us on a flight to London arriving in Paris Sunday am. I said ""no"" and got a flight from New York to Paris arriving by 7:00am Sunday. We had an 11 hour layover in New York, American didn't give us a room to sleep and when I filed a $599 claim with them (lost Saturday evening hotel room in Paris) it took them weeks to finally give us two $125 trip credits for a future American Airlines flight - THAT'S $349 LESS THAN OUR MONETARY DAMAGES AND IT WOULD FORCE US TO FLY AMERICAN WHICH WE'LL AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE! BTW - the pilot said that the reason for the delay and then changed flight to New York was that the aircraft had two required communications devices on board for Atlantic crossings, but neither of them worked. This is basic negligence."
736,✅ Trip Verified |  This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. I fly quite often and I will never fly American again. There is always a problem with a plane or my flight gets cancelled. Better yet they even will lose your baggage and customer service says that’s not their problem. This is the last time I will fly this airline.
737,✅ Trip Verified | We were held captive on the plane for 6 hours and never left JFK airport. Never offered food or drink. After 6 hours held hostage told to get off flight cancelled for no reason. No flight given to me to get to my vacation. I paid $2600 for a vacation I never got to have. Fighting everyday for AA to refund my tickets. Lost money on my Hotel and Rental car. Their people are rude and do not care. I will never ever fly again after this horrible experience and losing $2600.
738,"Not Verified |  We boarded our flight 549 at 12:30pm on May 4, 2023. I am writing this review as we are still sitting on the plane on the ground at the Charlotte airport at 2:48pm. I am pregnant and over heating. This is the first and last time I will be flying this airline. It took two hours for us to even be offered water. "
739,"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely the worst airline, consistently. Never not had a problem with them. I’m a Delta platinum SkyMiles member too so I’m an experienced flyer. Been charged twice for the same flight because they are such a scam. Consistently have problems with them. Do yourself a favor and fly United or Delta."
740,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have never had such a horrible experience with an airline before. Our flight home was cancelled twice over a two day span. The first night we were not compensated for anything. The second day we sat on the runway for 3 hours because netting was caught in the cargo door, meaning we missed our connecting flight from PHL to SEA. We were then given a voucher for 1 night at a hotel and $24 for both of us to eat, and put on a flight for the next day. That's it. They refuse to compensate for the first night, no compensation for the 12 hour shift of work I was forced to miss, and they wouldn't even upgrade our seats for all the hassle. In fact, our nonstop, 6 hour flight from PHL to SEA has turned into a 9 hour flight with a stop in DFW. Also, the wifi wouldnt connect. We were told too many people were already connected, and we were in the first half of people to board. Never flying AA again!"
741,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am amazed that this airline can keep in business. I flew Delta to my destination, but AA on the way back. Never again. Don’t care if Delta charges a bit more, AA is that bad in comparison. I have a horrible back from 21+ years of military service which prevents me from sitting in a chair for a time. So I was standing up by the back lavatories. Some male flight attendant rudely told me that I posed some kind of “safety hazard” in doing so. I suppose he didn’t care for my presence and invading his space. I am well aware of the dangers associated with being out of my seat without the seatbelt secured, but why would one make such a statement without knowing the reasoning? On international flights, I have hung out in the same spot for 85% of the flight and had great times conversing with the flight attendants. Nope not AA! Furthermore, both these flights required passengers to check their carry on’s at the gate. What? I’ve been flying since I was knee high and have never experienced this. Very poor quality all around. Considering that this is just the service and such shortcuts are taken, what other shortcuts are being taken that we don’t know about (plane functionality, flight checks, etc). No thank you for me. Don’t say I didn’t warn you."
742,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines did have a major flight delay/cancellation issue that caused me some problems on my trip. However, I was able to contact customer service and they refunded my costs and then some. I'm very pleased with how reasonable they responded to the situation and will be using their services again in the future."
743,✅ Trip Verified | We flew American Airlines from Phoenix to Portugal. We spent 3 weeks in Portugal and Spain. We flew back today from Barcelona. We just want to thank American Airlines because of the extremely helpful staff that they have all over the world. We had no idea how to navigate Barcelona Airport this morning. They made it so easy for us. It was our first time in Europe. We will definitely fly with American Airlines again. Thank you.
744,Not Verified |  I have flown with over 20 airlines in business and my flight was easily the worst I have ever experienced. The staff do not appear to want to be working! In business they stuffed economy passengers luggage in my overhead. The flight from New Orleans to Dallas in first class was 90 minutes and they served a bag of peanuts only! Avoid at all cost. I will avoid them at all cost! No wonder their rating is 2/10. I think that is generous.
745,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolute worst airline experience of my life. Flight from Charlotte to BWI cancelled. Customer service would not assist in accommodations at all. They rebooked to fly further south (south Carolina, then to DC the next day) then the flight to SC wad cancelled as boarding was called. Also told ""nothing we can do to help you."" If I could give zero stars I would"
746,"Not Verified | The day started with an early morning flight which was delayed due to mechanical issues. They were able to get us boarded but we knew our layover in Washington was going to be tight. We were able to land 30 minutes before our connecting flight. However, there was gate delays which left us running for our connecting flight. Myself and about 5 others from the same flight reached our connecting gate and were told the gate was closed and we would have to rebook. Staff at the gate was rude and unapologetic. They refused to open the gate for us even though it was still before the scheduled take off time. We were forced to rebook with a flight which would not get us in until 10 hours later. Spent the entire day in four different airports and experienced countless delays on flights ranging from leaking bathroom sinks and spots not available at the gate. Needless to say what should have been a four hour travel time turned into a 13 hour travel day thanks to American Airlines. Spent my entire birthday on top of it in airports and stuck waiting on planes. Please save your money and book with an airline that actually cares about its customers."
747,Not Verified |  Me and my husband boarded a flight from LaGuardia to DFW and had a layover in DFW to then board a flight to HOU. First off our first flight was delayed for seemingly no reason by 3 hours. So we then missed our connecting flight. They hooked us up on another flight to George bush where we sat in the plane for 45 mins before we were informed it was cancelled due to weather. We proceeded to sit in the plane for another hour and a half with them refusing to let us off. Finally after 2 hours they let the flight out and the guy at the gate thought we just flew in from Omaha?? We then proceeded to sit in the longest customer service line ever in which they told us the next flight they could get us on was 4 pm the next day. Which they had already boarded our checked luggage on without our knowledge. Whether I wanted to take the flight or not never mind I was forced to check it because our first flight over head bins were too full. Now our luggage is flying into Houston at 4 pm and me and my husband will not be there to pick it up. I have never had issues with any other airline like this. Single-handedly one of the worst days of my life due to incompetent people who don’t care about they’re customers at all. I cannot believe the way American Airlines handled this. I’m giving you this warning save yourself a lot of pain and never fly with them.
748,"Not Verified |  First flight delayed, caused me to miss my connecting flight, then my new connecting flight delayed by a few hours. On top of that, we were supposed to fly into SNA. Mid flight, they diverted us to LAX. They knew we weren’t going to make it to SNA before the curfew but didn’t tell us we were going to LAX till half way through the flight."
749,✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed fly from JAX to DFW on April 20th 2023 at 7:52pm. American cancelled the flight around 10pm that night and rebooked me for the next day at the same time. The flight didn’t leave the following day until 11:55pm. I am flying back out on Monday to St. Thomas and I paid to sit in extra main. They changed my seat and put me in the back of the plane without notifying me. I fly with American every month for business but this is it for me. 
750,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines left us and at least 100 other passengers to fend for ourselves in Charlotte. We ended up driving the 900 miles to Boston because, unlike AA, we take our jobs seriously. We flew to Punta Cana with our son, daughter-in-law, and grandson for a week of relaxation. Flight leaving DR was delayed by more than 2 hours due to 'equipment issues"". Nothing was said in-flight about connections not being held in Charlotte. We cleared customs, had to go back through TSA and R A N to the connecting gate. Plane was still at the gate but gate agents refused boarding. We were told we had to go to customer service which had a 2+ hour long line. AA Screwed so many people that there were no hotel rooms left. We, and many others, slept on the grubby floor with assurances we would be on the 8 am flight Sunday. That flight was overbooked. Maybe the 10am? Not a chance, but we should stay there and keep trying. When finally asked a very direct question the gate agents confessed there was no way to get us out of there before Tuesday! 96 hours later than the time AA contracted with us by way of our paid tickets. That is unacceptable in any business. From the second the PC flight was delayed, American Airlines knew exactly where every passenger was and where they need to go. They made no attempt to get any of us where we needed to be. This could have been done while we were enroute. The attitude of the AA employees was that somehow this was the fault of the passengers. I wish I had looked up their abysmal record before we let our agent book us with our travel plans. Never again."
751,"✅ Trip Verified | In Dallas, we were completely loaded on the plane when pilot announced that a glass on the instrument panel was broken and had to be fixed. Did the pilots who just landed the plane not notice before they got off? Then they allowed us off the plane to try to get another flight. But first we had to wait in one line to ""put our name on a list"" then get in a second line to get a new ticket. What the heck was that for? Gate agents were not very helpful with questions."
752,"Not Verified |  So, preparing for my flight, I recently bought a brand new suitcase set. They were quite nice and were not cheap by no means. The smaller bag has a numerical lock on the front. I guess at some point after I had checked my bags they felt the need to search this particular one. Well, though I am fairly certain the code was set so all they had to do was push a button to open it, this is not what happened. Instead of checking the lock, or even finding away to speak with the owner of the bag to get the code, they busted it open. Definitely weren't careful about it at all. By the time the bag made it back to me, the lock had been rigged to look like it could stay closed, though my bag was actually being held closed by tape. Once I was able to open my bag I found a little piece of paper stuck in there with a paragraph highlighted claiming that they are not liable for the damage cause to any of my items while searching my bag. I don't understand why no other actions, besides damaging my property, were taken. My bag is completely unable to be used and I still have to fly home. Now I will have to pay to have it fixed or replaced simply because they couldn't be bothered to ask a simple question."
753,"✅ Trip Verified | The first time to use this airline. Wonderful crews on all four flights. Terrible weather handled well by competent pilots. One flight, DFW to SLC was cancelled due to weather and American supervisor rebooked me for same great seat on the next morning flight. Yep, slept in the airport but that was OK, can’t control the weather. I bought my tickets on a deep deep discount and American Airlines did not treat me as though I did. Thank you"
754,"Not Verified |  They scheduled our connecting flight so close to the arrival from Spokane that we missed our flight to New Orleans, had to jump through hoops to possibly get tickets on a later flight, stand in a 3 hour line, and I still think they are a bunch of liars who gave us nothing! Why not hold up the connecting flight when several people on the arriving flight get here late because of their incompetence. Thanks for ruining part of our vacation."
755,"Not Verified |  I will never fly American again! They missed my connecting flight on the way to Costa Rica and I spent seven hours in Miami airport. Now, I have been delayed and diverted on my return flight, so not only will I miss my connection again, I will have to find overnight accommodations and take an unpaid day off work tomorrow. Oh, and to make things better, all of the flights from Mimi to Newark tomorrow have layovers. Why should I expect them to be made?"
756,✅ Trip Verified | Flight got delayed and delayed for hours without warning. Plane was old and dirty. They didn’t offer anything to the all the people that got stuck due to the delays.
757,"Not Verified |  I have been flying for 55 years and worked in the airline industry for 12. This by far has been my worst experience Ever! I checked by bag into Jacksonville airport about and hour and 20 minutes before my flight. The security line was not exceptionally long, BUT, it moved slower than any security I have ever experienced. They only have 2 security screening lines to screen bags. I got to the gate 3 minutes before my flight was suppose to leave because of the line in security, and the plane was gone. The gate agents were extremely rude and offensive. (It's not our fault that you werent at the gate) They were very unhelpful. They booked me on a flight that left at 7:45 out of Jacksonville the next morning, when there was a flight that left at 5:45. I had to have the morning crew rebook me on the earlier flight after a horrible night in the airport and the gate agents being rude and aggressive toward me. (This gate closes, you cant stay here! You have to go outside of security.) Then when I got to Dallas, the gate was changed 4 times. I went from D concourse to A concourse then back to D and then different gates as well. I was not able to get on the first flight but was able to get on the second. When I finally got to Salt Lake City, they had lost my bag and I did not get it until the next day. I should have gotten into Salt Lake City at midnight on Saturday and did not get to my destination until Sunday afternoon. There was not one, I am sorry, let me see what I can do to help. Just a whole lot of rude abrasive people that I came into contact with. This is the abbreviated version of the horror that happened to me on my return flight to see my son and grandchildren. Needless to say, I will never fly on American airlines again!"
758,✅ Trip Verified |  Mechanical problems causing 2 hours delay. Because of that I missed my flight to Atlanta. Rude AA employee at the gate. Missed a day of work and my boss got mad at me. They are always late 15 or 20 minutes late but this time was too much.
759,"Not Verified | Worst airline experience I have ever had to deal with. I was on standby with my fiancé. They called us and told us they only had one seat left so we had to decline, minutes later they opened up seating for a family of 5 and we could no longer get on because they passed us by since we “declined”. The workers do not seem to know what they are doing either. If you want a stress free flight, choose Southwest. I have flown with them a bunch and they always have been good!"
760,"✅ Trip Verified |  Great staff at both MSP and LIH, terrible experience flying through PHX (ironically self-titled ""Friendliest Airport""). We travel with a 3 & 4 year old and have brought our collapsible radio flyer wagon on many airlines the past 4 years, including such demons as Spirit and Frontier ... so didn't think twice about it on a ""name-brand"" airline. We had no issues valet checking at MSP however in PHX both ways they stripped the valet tag and forced it to be checked to baggage claim. I questioned why this would be and was told safety as wagons are ""too heavy"" for the workers to carry up for valet luggage, and looking at their website they apparently have unilaterally declared a ""stroller war"" and don't allow strollers > 20lbs. Good luck if you are a single parent travelling with twins! I know this wagon is quite light, much lighter than any strollers other than the umbrella stroller and asked that they simply weigh it. They refused. I later looked it up and this wagon weighs 18.67 lbs according to the specifications. LIH wasn't too bad and we managed to get to baggage claim without too much trouble, just a grumpy wife. MSP was much more difficult trying to carry both our sleepy little ones and our carryon luggage as we had clearly planned to use the wagon for the kids (about 75lbs)... American Airlines is officially America's least family friendly airline in my book. I'm giving them 3 stars because one gate agent was apologetic but the other direction she was terrible... Also on our 7 hour flight to Lihue they had almost none of the purchasable food items, no way to get anything approaching a meal..."
761,"✅ Trip Verified | The worst airline personnel at the check in and at the gate! Unprofessional, rude and totally out of touch with the needs of the First Class customers who are paying a premium for being treated courteously. My confirmed booking was for a later flight and I tried to leave on an earlier flight. They had first class seats when I checked online but at the airport they put me on stand-by. I was the very last person to be assigned a seat at the back of the plane when I had told the gate agent I was a First Class passenger. The gate agent was extremely rude, never listened to what I said to her and assumed as a First Class passenger it was going to be acceptable to me to fly in the middle seat at the back of the plane?! The ticketing agent never mentioned to me that the stand-by was a down grade to lowest fare economy which I would have declined in the first place. My preferred airline is Delta and this could be the last time I fly this lowlife airline!"
762,Not Verified |  Worst experience of my life. I had a flight the previous day and it was delayed to my connector flight that I would then miss. There would not have been any later flights from my connector so I rescheduled for the next day and then the same exact thing happened. Every single experience I’ve ever had with American Airlines has had a delay.
763,Not Verified | All of our flights during our trip were on time or early arrival. My bag was ripped during our trip to DR but I reported after returning and I heard within a few days that AA would be sending me a check for the amount that I estimated the bag which was fairly new was worth.
764,"✅ Trip Verified | I purchased a flight for my mom to come to Louisville for a visit but her flight was delayed multiple times then canceled, I was able to get her rebooked for the very next morning but that flight was canceled as well and now the airline is trying to book her on another day altogether which won’t work because we were taking her to Gatlinburg for her first time there and changing her flight to a completely day that would prevent us from doing so. They wouldn’t even change her flight to an airline close to Gatlinburg and they refuse to give me a refund. I don’t know how they can treat people like this and get away with it."
765,"Not Verified | I booked a trip to Guatemala for my boyfriend and me months ago. When i booked the flight I carefully chose our seat assignments because my boyfriend has back issues. Two days before our flight, I went on the American Airlines website to make sure our flight status was good. Once on the site, I saw that our seat assignments had disappeared. Panicked, I clicked to see what was left and there is nothing, one middle seat in the back of the plane. I carefully chose a seat with leg room in the aisle for my boyfriend because he will need to get up frequently. I called American airlines and waited on hold for 90 mins on a workday two days before my trip. They never gave a time estimate for hold or an option for a call back. I finally reached a representative who told me that an agent had made a change in the flight and had failed to reassign the seats I'd chosen. I asked why no one emailed me, the representative claimed American had sent an email to my boyfriend....that made no sense. I booked the flights, I had all of the confirmations and ticket info. I demanded to be given seats at no additional cost. The representative asked me to wait on hold, then disconnected me. Unlike other airlines, the representative had not asked for my contact information should we be disconnected. She likely did it on purpose because she didn't want to deal with American Airlines mistake. I am not on hold for my second hour when I have a million things to do to prepare for this trip. NEVER FLYING WITH THEM AGAIN."
766,"✅ Trip Verified | Used AA twice in March. Once from YYZ to MIA on March 2nd with AA 1572 and return flight on March 13th from MIA to YYZ with AA 1572. After reading numerous bad reviews I do feel obliged to write my review even though the flights were done a few weeks ago. Check in were both time swift and friendly, boarding was highly civilised, flights left and arrived on time, planes were clean, service was attentive and friendly. Travelled with dog in cabin and all rules were explained and followed in a non threatening and pleasant way. There were absolutely no complaints from my side whatsoever. Even the ticket price was highly competitive. I see no reason not to give 10 points and thumbs up."
767,Not Verified |  After they let most people with carry-on bags on board they stopped me and a few other passengers with large bags and took my small carry-on bag away claiming I cannot put under my seat. Horrible experience. Plus my original flight was delayed so I had to take a red eye and was late for my meeting. I will never book with American Airlines. I flew with other airlines and have never had this horrible experience. The counter person did not know anything and kept saying they cannot get me into different Airline but another person corrected him. The counter person seemed fake and not trying or caring.
768,"Not Verified |  This is the fourth time I've driven 1.5 hours to the airport to get thru security and have AA cancel my flight, leaving me stranded, having paid a lot of money for ride to airport, dog sitting etc, i cannot express my outrage. How are they allowed to continue mistreating humans like this and not somehow be penalized. Its not the weather, shouldnt they have to maintain some sort of quality so as not to cost me thousands in losses from having to redo my plans each time? I'm forced to fly them due to the rural nature of where I live. They are consistently 100 percent horrible."
769,"✅ Trip Verified | This was ridiculous and audacious. This was our first time with American and also our last. We flew from Munich via Charlotte to Charleston, South Carolina. On our flight from CLT to CHS, we were already about one and a half hours delayed, apparently due to an aircraft change. That in itself wasn’t nice, but if would’ve been somewhat acceptable. The real problems started on our return flight back to Munich, as we left CHS with a delay of over 2 hours. Since AAs schedule is ridiculously tight, the delay caused us (and many other passengers with connecting flights) to miss our connections. We missed our flight by a grand total of 5 minutes, because they couldn’t hold the aircraft an additional five minutes (especially since we weren’t the only ones running to catch that specific flight). We were then sent to a service desk to arrange a re-booking and initially hoped to be re-booked onto a later flight with Lufthansa or British Airways (which is a Oneworld member so re-booking would’ve been logical), but the agent didn’t even bother to check if they had any seats available and just told us we’d have to wait 24 hours for the next flight with AA since they only re-book passengers to another airline if they can’t get you to your destination within 24 hours. While they did give us two hotel rooms for the night, they only provided one food voucher (12$ per person, which was absolutely ridiculous. In the end, I missed parts of my university exams and my father missed an important business meeting, both of which we would’ve been able to attend had we been re-booked to British Airways. Oh and while I’m at it: don’t expect to get your luggage before departing for the hotel. We asked to retrieve it and were told, we’d have to wait between 2-8 hours to get it delivered (keep in mind, it was 7pm), which meant we were stuck in the hotel (which thankfully provided some amenities) with just our carry-ons. It became apparent there is no communication between and knowledge of other departments with AA staff since the re-booking agent told us we‘d get our bags right away, while the guys at the baggage claim said the above. The baggage guys (also from AA) even said there was no communication between departments and certainly no mutual help. This experience and the treatment we received was quite literally the worst we’ve ever had with any airline (and we are frequent fliers), be it a US or other airline. Just something I‘d like to add as well: when we arrived at the hotel, we were told that this treatment is quite common with AA and that, on average, they accommodate many AA passengers daily due to missed or cancelled connections. Though I feel obliged to point out that the flights and flight crews were actually quite good (good food, clean aircraft, friendly crew), but the management, as mentioned, is just horrible. If you have a booking with AA, do yourself a favor and find a different airline, that way you‘ll save yourself a lot of grief and anger."
770,Not Verified |  4 flights in 3 days not a single one of they was on time. 3 were delayed for maintenance. I will never fly this airline again. 
771,"✅ Trip Verified |  I don’t like to leave reviews, but after the constant let down by American Airlines has been giving us, a review has to be made. We booked back in October 2022 for my husbands and I honeymoon with reserved seats. After checking in the boarding ticket completely switched our seats and the customer service response was that the system changed it and they have no guarantee that we’d get the seats. Last time I checked I didn’t book with Southwest Airlines. I had hoped our honeymoon would pan out to be different, but obviously the phrase “fool me once-shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me” is so true when booking with this airline."
772,"Not Verified |  Lacking consistency. I'm often feeling lack of appreciation of business given. I fly every week with American Airlines for the last couple years and was excited to earn that status I have. Pretty disappointed so far. Initially I passed my frustrations off due to the pandemic, understanding the added stress the staff had to go through but I guess that became the new norm. My company gives us choice of preferred airline and the majority of my company flies Delta. It's been an ongoing joke difference of the level of perks, appreciation and treatment that Delta gives over American. Delta flyers get free sky club, while I have to pay for Admirals club, Delta give free clear membership while i have to pay, delta gives free recheck while i have to pay. Delta can use mile for flight changes, I cant with American. No wonder Delta flyers are happy and loyal. Although I had made the decision to be loyal to AA, I'm not happy and I'm getting tired of seeing the satisfaction of my co workers while I'm left feeling wanting. I guess it's about time to consider what continues to be recommended, making a status change. Delta you look more and more appealing every week."
773,✅ Trip Verified |  I was on flight 1036 and I happened to leave my sunglasses at security. Sandra and the other flight attendants were very helpful and the captain even attempted to get them back. Thanks for being so nice you got a customer for life
774,"✅ Trip Verified |  Firstly American flights are canceled and delayed and agents are not courteous and patient with customers. There are no explanations why flights canceled and the agents remarks they are tired and frustrated about it too. I begin my trip by arriving 3 hrs before my flight from ORD to ONT, to learnt at the checkin counter that my original flight is delayed and I will missed my connecting. At that time I had to beg the agent to look for another flight out from Chicago. However, after 40 mins or so, she got one through Phoenix. When I arrived Phoenix was further delay for 7 hrs before leaving at 11pm to ONT. My thoughts are the airline canceled flights then to combine passengers into one flight, but does not publish or shared with customers. They do not care how tired and harassed are the passengers that are going through this process. I had two important appointments that I missed during all this course of travel and none of the agents shows any concerns to the passengers that had to site for hours. The irony of all this, my checked bag was 50.05lbs and they asked me to open and remove something, so it get below 50lbs. Also, if you complained on an issue, they become very vindictive and further try to delay you from boarding American Airlines needs to improve on there schedule and retrain those agents that becomes complacent I am. Frequent traveler go AA and hope to continue, but they need to address and improve and stick to your reservation flights schedule."
775,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a truly horrendous traveling experience with American Airlines on my return flight from Newark to DFW. My flight was scheduled for 6:30 pm, and I arrived at the airport at 4 pm to go through the tedious security check. Upon reaching the gate, I was informed that my flight was delayed by an hour. As time passed, the delay kept extending, and we were eventually told that we would only be boarding the plane at around 9:45 pm to 10 pm. After boarding and taxiing for half an hour, the pilot announced that they had exceeded their allowed hours, and we would have to go back to the terminal. It was incredibly frustrating to have to go through the entire boarding process only to be turned back due to an issue that should have been sorted out beforehand. Upon returning to the terminal, we were informed that the flight had been canceled, and we would have to wait until the next day to fly out at 11:15 am. The process of waiting in line at the AA counter to secure a hotel reservation for the night was a frustrating two-hour ordeal. When I finally arrived at the hotel, I was informed that they had not received any information about my reservation. Luckily, they had a room available, but it was an unnecessary inconvenience after an already stressful day. The next day, we arrived at the airport at 8 am, went through security again, and boarded the plane. However, after only half an hour, we were informed that there was a technical issue with the plane, and we had to disembark yet again. I was fed up with the constant delays and decided to book a flight with United while waiting in line for a refund. The whole ordeal cost me $850 for a one-way ticket for myself and my wife. Overall, this experience was a complete nightmare, and I have decided never to travel with American Airlines again. I will make sure to share my experience with anyone who asks for recommendations."
776,✅ Trip Verified |  Today our flight was delayed 5 hours (with less than 30 mins notice from our boarding time). We missed our connecting flight. Our entire trip is delayed 24 hours and we lose a whole day. Had they notified us sooner we could have rearranged things and saved a day. The last time I flew with American they cancelled my flight last minute. Sent me to two different connecting flights with barely enough time to make it. Told me they would pay for my hotel for the evening but never did. Another time they not only delayed our flights home and added a day to the trip but also lost our luggage. This airline is absolute trash. Never again will I fly with American.
777,"Not Verified |  Flying American airlines on March 12th and March 13th was the worst experience of my life! My flight was supposed to leave at 7 am on 3/12. My flight was then delayed to 2:43 pm, then to 4:05 pm then to 4:26 pm. I had a connecting flight to charlotte. I noticed that my connecting flight was within a ten minute time frame to depart upon me landing. I asked the gate attendant about it and she said the flight from Charleston is only 30 minutes so I should get there in time. Well the flight was 50 minutes and we landed in terminal A and my connecting flight was terminal C. Myself and others tried to get there and it was to late. The flight was closed and there was 7 minutes left before departure but they said they could not let us on. We had to go to the customer service counter to get another flight out of charlotte. I got another flight going to DFW that was to depart at 7:22 pm then it was delayed to 8:04 then again to 8:24.. we finally boarded and got ready to take off and then there was engine trouble, we sat on the tarmac for at least 2 hours before everything was fixed. I knew then that I would not make my connection flight in Dallas because of the delay in Charlotte. My connecting fight was to take off at 11:30. We got to Dallas at 1 am. American airlines got rid of the rest of the itinerary. Now I sit in the airport with no where to go, everything is closed. I finally called American airlines and was on hold for 2 hours. They got me on a flight at 10:55 am which at this point was 6 hours away. This flight was delayed by 40 minutes and I finally got home at 2pm PST. After trying to get home since 7 am on 3/12 I finally made it home on 3/13 at 2pm. I have since emailed a complaint for a refund or some sort of compensation for my troubles and missing work on Monday. I will never fly them again!"
778,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a connecting flight where they closed the gate on us right as we rushed there. They didn't even realize we were on a connection when they looked at our boarding passes and said ""well you have to get here with enough time so that you don't miss your flight"". Completely smug attitude with no sense or urgency. We explained that we had a connection and the flight still had 15-20 mins until it's scheduled departure time and how did they not see that the two missing passengers were from a connecting American Airlines flight that had just landed. It's like they've never dealt with a connecting flight before. I get if the flight is 30+ minutes late and you can't hold up another departing flight for that long but there was still PLENTY of time to spare. Horrible gate agent not doing the basics simply seeing where the two missing passengers were coming from. The manager came and said it would take too long to reopen the flights. I get when the gate is closed and all that final stuff but they closed it 20 minutes before the flight and should have known we were coming from a connection. A good airline would take notice of that and hold off for as long as possible. I've had this happen before with Southwest and they did the right thing. We argued with this guy for 20 minutes telling us how long it would take to reopen the flight blah blah while watching our plane still just sit there and not even back up yet. We would have been in our seats sitting down 10-15 minutes ago but all he would do is say ""sorry nothing we can do"" Ridiculous. Airline is run by lazy clowns, it's no wonder they had all that controversy during covid kicking families off planes for their 1 year old not having a mask on. Absolute clown of an airline."
779,"Not Verified |  Wow! I just read a review of American that sounds a lot like my experience! My daughter and I traveled to Key West just for 3 days, so all we had were carry-ons. In spite of purchasing tickets in November, we were group 7 boarding. Upon boarding in Miami, we were told that we had to check our carry-ons due to ""weight distribution."" I was fuming! Upon arrival in Key West, we had to wait over 25 minutes for our luggage. Because of this, friends who came to pick us up couldn't wait, so we had to pay for a taxi to take us to our B&B! I called American later the same night and was told that the agents at the gate told me ""3 times that the bins were full!"" What a bunch of liars! The bin above us had one piece of luggage in it, the bin across from us was completely empty, there were other bins with space on the way down to our seats. They are blatant liars! I have had stuff stolen from my luggage in the past and pack all my electronics, make-up, medication, etc in my carry-on so it's in my possession at all times! I don't use a lock on my carry-on due to the fact that this carry-on is going to be in my possession. I will never use this airline again. I will fly Southwest (my favorite airline) to Miami and rent a car and drive to Key West. Absolutely infuriated!"
780,"✅ Trip Verified |  Missed flight by a couple of seconds. Won’t let us on. Rebooking line is about 8 groups of people but took 2 hours, yes 2 hours. Instead of a 6 hour flight now we have to waste 16 more hours flying to random places. Ok, at least the agent did help us rebook. Told us gate d14, boarding now. We went from the rebooking booth with is next to gate d37 to d14, when we arrived there were only a couple of people there, waiting for the same flight since an hour ago, and there is no agent around to be seen or signs or broadcasts. I checked the flight info board two gates away, it said d43 for our flight instead. So we had to run all the way back the direction we came from and almost missed the flight again. Planes are 737max, the awesome ones that have no screen. Since they have no screen the stewardess had to demo the safety instructions. I cannot recollect when I've seen that last. On our previous leg, we and a lot of other people were told that the overhead bins were full so we need to check in our bags. After the gate check in madness, when we boarded we noted a lot of empty spaces, so much so that on take off and landing you hear luggage moving to the front and back in the compartments due to the empty spaces. And of course, our brand new carry on luggage was damaged and beat up. Overall an extremely poorly managed airline. If not for the name American I would expect it to be out of business like yesterday."
781,"Not Verified | The service when we first arrived was decent. It was very crowded and an American Airline employee yelled at me and my family. We checked our 5 bags and went through security which went well. The flight went well as well. When we land and go to baggage claim 3 of our 5 bags are missing. We were told we won’t get them until the next day at noon earliest. So now I’m stuck in another country without any of my clothes, or hygiene products."
782,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines has finally dropped to the one star category in my opinion, it is actually quite unbelievable how the quality of every aspect of American Airlines has dropped. All the staff from cabin crew to flight crew look disheveled and fed up, uniforms have gone out the window, the cabin crew wear whatever they want and generally they are disinterested. The food, covered many times on this forum goes from bad to worse and in most cases is in fact inedible, I am quite sure that it has been many years since anyone in AA actually tasted or reviewed the food. The seat on the flight in the Flagship Business was not functioning and remained in the upright position for the entire flight, the only available seat was 1A which I was told was reserved by the FAA and in fact turned out 5 hours into the flight was for the captain to have a nap for 2 hours before returning to the cockpit. This really sums up everything about AA, the crew are more important than the paying passengers and the passengers are merely a distraction while the staff wait for their pensions or redundancies. As far as I know, no other 'reputable' airline puts its staff in premium seats, they use cabin rest areas, this seat should have been given up to accommodate the paying passenger, who also happens to be an Advantage Platinum member, what does it say about an airline that makes a paying passenger sit upright for 8 hours and lets the captain use a seat for a 2 hours when there is a crew rest area on the 777-200 aircraft? I have flown AA many times and no matter what happens or what situation occurs I will never fly with AA again. On the take off from Miami all the window blinds remained down and nobody appeared to be bothered, with the 25 year old planes, the lack of maintenance and despite the disinterested crew and the terrible service AA will always have passengers that have to fly, but those with a choice with certainly not choose American Airlines. I wonder how long it will be before AA is actually a 1 Star airline on Skytrax, it has fallen steadily over the last few years and it would seem that Management are completely oblivious to the disgraceful state of the airline."
783,"Not Verified |  Terrible service. Forced checked bags for 20-30 customers. Rude people at the desk when boarding. Just a joke of an airline. To anyone reading this, do yourself a favor and fly Delta. They treat people like people and don’t force people to check their bags. They also don’t keep rude people at their onboarding desk who are happy about their 2 minutes of power."
784,"Not Verified |  Absolutely horrid experience. They made us check in our carry on bag because they ""ran out of space"" even after we told them that we have a very close connecting flight and our bags won't make it if they are checked in. The American Airlines representative working the desk said ""I do not care you are checking your carry on"" and was overall very rude about the whole thing. Of course, the bags didn't make it and were delayed for a day of our trip. We had to go out and buy necessities instead of enjoying the sun on the first day. The same thing happened on the returning flight but whatever, we have other stuff at home. We kept our receipts and needed help filing a claim so we called customer support who said we can't speak to a representative because we don't have a claim? So after having to translate every item on every receipt from Spanish and listing them out on my claim I can't speak to an agent. Garbage airline would literally pay extra money to fly anything else."
785,Not Verified |  I fly American Airlines a couple times a month because they are the only option in my small town. The customer service is beyond terrible! I have problems with almost every flight and can never get customer service. I've spent hours on the phone and in emails trying to get assistance to no avail. Garbage airline with people that treat customers like trash.
786,"✅ Trip Verified |  I purchased my husband and myself Business Class tickets from Raleigh to Porto. I noticed after purchasing the tickets that I did not have seat assignments for all the flights. So I waited a few weeks and then checked back - still no seat assignments. I tried to get the assignments online and could not do it. So, I started calling the Airlines. I called both American Airlines (whom I purchased tickets from) and then also called Iberia (whom is a codeshare on part of the flights). American referred me back to Iberia and then Iberia then referred me back to American - both stating they couldn't help with seat assignments, which I found odd. American said they couldn't help because Iberia was in control of the seats and Iberia said they couldn't help because American sold me the tickets and were responsible for seating. The American Airlines representative even at one point said I could not get seat assignments because I wasn't part of the Platinum Program - I reminded her that these were not coach tickets and that I had paid for Business Class. She then went on to say that they have problems with Iberia and can't get seats assigned. She said we should have seats and when we check in at the gate they would be assigned there somewhere on the plane. I even asked if American Agent could message Iberia and make sure we had seats on the planes. She said she could not do so, but thought we would have seats if the flights weren't sold out. I told here we have tickets and she said she could see we had tickets purchased in Business Class and that we should have seats on the various flights. It just seems wrong somehow that we bought Business Class tickets at $3500 per person and can't get seat assignments. I can honestly say in my years of flying I have never had this problem and such poor service from two different Airlines. Lesson from my story - Don't buy tickets from American Airlines as they don't help you with seating. And be particularly careful if it is an American Airline flight number that shows a codeshare on another airlines"
787,"✅ Trip Verified |  Fails on multiple accounts. Twenty minutes before boarding my first flight, I received notifications that my connecting flight was completely cancelled. No offer of explanation or reason and only the automated, ""We are working to resolve this"" statement. Only had available options for new flights, which were limited due to the fact that it was going to a very small airport with only one way in, therefore a known limited dependence on their airline. When I, myself, found another flight that would have gotten me to a nearby airport and presented to that gate in another terminal just as they were about to close, the representative at the gate denied my boarding, even though there was space, because, ""I did not have any visible interruptions on my record via the record locator"" because I had reflexively chosen the first available new flight option to have something  on the agenda. All that despite the multiple texts, emails, notification of the clear cancellation of my connecting arriving flight. 3After I was able to find an equivalent of this second alternative route with a pleasant LAX AA customer rep via United Airlines, both he and the United airlines rep reported that I still had my return flights. However, the next day when i was checking status of the flights, they no longer appeared, and I was no longer on those flights, I suspect due to the fact that I was never cancelled from my original flights and as I did not board those, it cancelled my returns. This was all discovered 6.5 hours prior to departure.  Even after I called and had those return flights rebooked under me, I had to ask the rep to check on the status, and only then did she relay that the outgoing first leg was already found to be delayed to arrive at my connecting airport 30-40 minutes after the connecting leg was supposed to takeoff, prompting to find ANOTHER alternative route, causing me to leave for home 5 hours earlier than expected for an already short trip. Because of all these changes, I have had the extra expense of finding a last minute rental car, as the alternative airport was 95 miles away, and the corresponding gas. Then I had to change the rental return last minute. Again, still no courtesy to explain why I was heavily inconvenienced at all in the first place. No offer to proactively help other than the automated, ""Here are alternative flights"". If I had not been proactive, I would have flown out of my original airport and gotten stuck at the layover for over 12 hrs, and arrived at my destination with less than 24hrs to spend. And THEN would have been forced to be delayed at my second layover, causing me to be late for work Monday morning. Will never fly with American again. Absolutely horrible experience and no remorse whatsoever. I have travelled on many airlines and am very accustomed to policies and procedures, but this was unacceptable. Thankfully I was travelling alone with one carry-on, due to the already short nature of the trip, but if I was going for work, or with my kids, or with a checked-in luggage, this would have been 10x more horrible."
788,"Not Verified |  I would never get American Airline credit card again - what is the point of paying fees if you cannot assist me with my issue. I have been on hold twice now for 45min still cannot get anyone on the phone. I tried booking a flight with British airways, when I went online to book it with my miles it was told did not have the economy option available. Five min later I booked it through British Airways with economy. They wouldn't let me use my miles on purpose. Such a shady airline. And why does it take $300 to do one hour flight from NC to FL. Found the same flight with Spirit for $52. Don't book with them! If you have any issues prepare to be on hold for over an hour. I would be happy to provide screenshot of my hold time."
789,"✅ Trip Verified | We had our flight diverted from Charlotte to Greensboro. This would not be an issue however American refused to comp hotel, food, or reasonable rebooking and I am stuck in Charlotte for 24 hours. The lack of respect at 2 am from most service representatives spoken too was disheartening. I would not fly American again due to this experience when given the option."
790,"✅ Trip Verified |  TSA was having issues in the priority line. They held all the people in this line, and they were given priority to a flight to La Guardia, an American Airlines flight. A lot of people missed their flight because these issues, of course including me. When I went to rebooking the front desk person was unable to book me in first class."
791,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience of my life. Had to reroute because a person who should have never been allowed to be on the flight in the first place. Poor customer service from the flight attendants and lack of information from the pilot. Arrived in Orlando airport to remove the person  and then waited on the plane for hours for them to figure out legal issues and fuel up which then told us there was no fuel so had to get off the plane and then wait use in TSA again and no help from American Airlines to direct us to our new gate or tell TSA to let us through. Delayed our flight multiple times. I will never fly American Airlines again. The ignorance, disrespect, and poor customer service disgusts me and I don’t even know how they are still in business. Did not give us any vouchers or accommodations for our time and missing out on work, travel pay and car etc."
792,✅ Trip Verified |  Highly disappointed. Flight was scheduled to leave at 630 am. Sitting on the flight line and might miss my connecting flight. Can't believe they'd board people if the plane needs maitenance while we are sitting on it. It should be put aside and a better plane to fly us safely to Charlotte. I'm connecting to Seattle and probably will miss my connecting flight. Very disappointed in this airline.
793,"Not Verified |  Pros: All flights departed on time, all seat selections honored including extra leg room, ground crew and cabin crew pleasant, meals and beverages were fine, all luggage made it to the final destination and all flights smooth. Cons: Check-in at EZE was chaotic. AA has multiple evening flights departing and check-in opens for all flights at the same time so 100's of people swarming around trying to figure out where to be. No signage or direction as to what line to get in to. My partner and I were split up into different lines even though we were together and on the same ticket (strange, but it all worked out). Passport and security checks were very crowded and took way too long. Finally made it to the gate where there was room to relax, sit and get some air before the flight home. My issues were more with EZE airport and not AA. I see so many negative comments about AA but I am happy to say that my luck with the airline has always been a good one. A side note about SFO airport. They have done away with all foreign currency exchange stations at the airport and that includes the international terminal. You will have to find other alternatives outside the airport to exchange foreign currency."
794,"Not Verified |  The most horrific experience of my life. Left home for schedule flight at 3am, only for a delay until 1047. That ended up delayed until 2pm. The gates continually changed, missing all of the rescheduled flights. Ended up in wonderful LA Guardia, but my luggage is now in JFK. "
795,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am convinced now that the only two requirements for becoming a flight attendant on AA is a lack of smile and a rude attitude. AA should go to Europe and learn about customer service. AA should definitely learn about food trays: bread hard as stone and cold, awful sauces, and cheap wine do not apply to in-flight restauration anymore."
796,"✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines has ignorant, zero empathy gate agents. I have anxiety on losing luggage because I had lost my luggage twice prior. At boarding gate I tried to explain that to the two gate agents and wait to board last. When being asked if no over head bin space left would I agree to check bag. I did agree. When walking to my seat I found space left in the over head bin. I asked to have my carry on stored there but was refused. The senior Gate agent went up to the plane with a completely stone face and say no because you want to store your bag that means we have to keep your bag there with absolutely no empathy for my anxiety. She seemed to enjoy watching my anxiety kicks."
797,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’m not kidding, every single time I fly America Airlines I’m either rushing to my connection because they are never on time or the flight is delayed and I’m missing my connection. I fly very often and actually have another flight for June planned with American Airlines that I will cancel to avoid the constant inconvenience of flying with them. The amount you save on the flight you spend at the airport waiting on the next flight because they can’t manage to get their act together. Very unreliable. Customer service is trash.  "
798,✅ Trip Verified |  Me and my wife were not seated together and when we asked to lady (Retta) to see if she could get us together she didn’t want to be bothered. She seemed very stressed so we just left it the way it was so as not to cause her more stress.
799,"Not Verified | I flew from San Antonio to Dallas for work. Without a doubt, it was the worst flying experience I've ever had. They canceled the flight 10 minutes before boarding due to maintenance issues. It took 3 hours to reschedule at the airport's customer service desk. After a missed meeting and hours wasted, I was ""generously"" offered a 50-dollar voucher after an online complaint. Given the option to ever fly American again, I would rather walk to my destination."
800,"✅ Trip Verified |  I purchased a ticket from Sint Maartin to Little Rock via Charlotte in October 2022 to travel on 2-14-23. The Charlotte to Little Rock departure was later changed so that I could not make the connection. I was not told of this change and my flight from Sint Maartin was left as ""pending"". By the time I became aware of the situation, the ""pending"" flight was completely full. This meant that I would arrive two days after originally scheduled. Since I had to administer a test (I teach at a university) before the rescheduled arrival, I had to purchase a ticket on Delta to get back in time ($495 extra cost). When I filed a complaint with American, they awarded me a $50 voucher."
801,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tickets for my flight were oversold, we arrived on time but we couldn't board the plane. I was offered to fly with my daughter tomorrow and my mother on Thursday 2/23 because there weren't 3 seats available. But I was told to keep checking in case someone canceled. I called back tonight twice. The 2nd time because there was a seat available online. But it was first class and if I chose to change it I would have to pay the difference bc it would be a ""voluntary change"". But changing my two tickets to Thursday could be done because is not first class, but we would only have 5 days left in Cuba, because i only have a 7 day vacation. The lady on the phone reminded me of the checks we got at the airport for the ""inconvenience"" but those don't pay for the costs of missing work, rentals in Cuba, family waiting in the airport, etc. My mother gets anxious when flying alone and needs help with the bags. It is very aggravating to know that there is an option for her to flight to Miami tomorrow but since it is first class she can't have it unless she pays more when all of this is happening bc of the airline in the first place."
802,Not Verified |  The customer service was fabulous. They put me on an earlier flight. They even transferred my luggage in a matter of moments. It was a wonderful trip. 
803,"Not Verified |  American Airlines never updated the Boarding Passes and the Gate was wrong. In addition, the gate listed on the board was incorrect. Despite these inconsistencies and rushing to several incorrect gates, we finally made it to our correct gate with 11 minutes to spare. The only problem was that staff had given our seats away and would not allow us to board. If someone makes an appt for something and shows up early, why on God's green earth would those spots be given away? These two gate assistant treated us like it was our fault and were rude on top of everything else. It's sad that there likely will be no repercussions for this type of treatment."
804,"✅ Trip Verified | This has to be the worst airline I have ever flown with. They are super unprofessional and do not communicate with their customers well, or at all. My aunt had to go through two random checks. Now I know one was security and that’s fine, but the other time they called her name and made her go again for no reason. The plane was running late and we boarded an hour after we were supposed to. No apologies and no one told us why we were running late. They are super rude and I will never be flying with them again. Worst experience ever."
805,"Not Verified |  Unhappy and disappointed with the airline, always have had good experiences, until today. I  missed the flight and not because of me - I was there 2 hours and 30 min prior, simply because the line was too long and they couldn’t process the passengers in a timely manner. I think that someone should reviews the process that they have in place since it’s not effective and much less efficient. I could have actually made it to the plane of someone would have ask if there are any passengers with the fly in the next hour or so, trying to help those people and get them on the plane since the circumstances were special. No help was provided at any point and the crew assigned to this task no comment. Pls help resolve this since I think is not professional I have to get to the airport 5 hours prior to the flight in order to get in."
806,"Not Verified |  This was the most horrible flight ever. Literally flights getting delayed and them not doing absolutely anything about it, saying it is not there fault or issue. They were rude, over the phone they tried to help, but everyone else in person was just disrespectful and rude. They have horrible communication - one person would tell us one thing, and another person would tell us completely different. Absolutely ridiculous, figure out the system American, you guys were horrible, never flying again"
807,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Buenos Aires via New York. Can't fault American Airlines, I seem to have good luck with them. All flights departed and arrived on time. All pre-selected seats honored. All luggage arrived to destination. Ground staff and cabin crew were all just fine. The A321 from SFO to JFK was a good plane. Had really bad clear weather turbulence, boarding on violent for about 2 hours that the pilot struggled with and did his best. Then ran into a heavy storm on the east coast and had to circle around a few times over the ocean before being able to land at JFK, but the pilot kept us informed. Landed at JFK and made it quickly over to the gate to catch our flight to Buenos Aires. Took off in the pouring rain right back into the storm we just got out of and had a few more hours of turbulence before the flight settled down. Food and drink service was standard economy meals and snacks with multiple beverages runs made. Made it to Burenos Aires, cleared customs and baggage arrived promptly. Only positive things to say on this journey."
808,"Not Verified |  My flight experience per the route noted and on my return from Phoenix through Charlotte to Harrisburg were uneventful and pleasant. Using the American Airlines app with the early check-in was easy. Mobile boarding passes are the GOAT. The app also helped me find my way from gate to gate in the Charlotte airport with approximate walking time. In fear of hiccups, I made sure my carry-on had everything I needed in the event my luggage didn't make the trip. I put an air tag in my luggage just for my own peace of mind. But the app also enabled me to know that my luggage was on board, so when I went to the baggage claim, I knew it was coming out eventually. No stress. For my trip out, I planned a long layover in Charlotte but on the way back, I changed my original flight and the choices were limited. My layover was less than an hour in Charlotte and I was a little worried about making my connecting. I was flying back two days after the Super Bowl, so there's that too. Honestly, all my flights were early upon arrival and I had no issues whatsoever with luggage. The in-flight crew was very friendly and helpful. Seriously, no bad vibes from anyone at all. You know how it can be -- people are professional and helpful, but somewhat unfriendly. That certainly was not the case at American Airlines in my experience. Obviously, I can't speak to what the service would've been like had issues arisen. In the event my flight didn't make my connecting on time on the way home, I was prepared to re-book and find a place close to stay for the night. Like I said above, I fully expected there might be hiccups and tried to anticipate them to the best of my ability - and stay calm Getting upset, while sometimes unavoidable, only makes things worse. I will also add that I witnessed no negative encounters during any of my four flights or while at the airports. In a day and age where you're sort of at the mercy of what you hear/read internet or other news, and when that news tends to spotlight everything that's wrong with our world, I would not have been surprised to witness or hear people being rude to each other, to staff, or just in general. Traveling is tiring. Airplane seating is tight. People get frustrated. I am happy to report that my trips were filled with kindness and courtesy. The only negative (and maybe I was technologically challenged) was that I would've had to pay extra to use the wifi. The in-flight entertainment was easily accessible, with a lot of choices - so that was good. I will definitely fly American again. I felt welcomed, accommodated, and safe."
809,"✅ Trip Verified | I have to say, I really regret ever trying to fly with American Airlines. Most airlines will give you a credit of some sort when you’re unable to make your flight, But not American Airlines. Back in November of 2022 I bought a ticket for my my wife to fly out to Honolulu this February of 2023. We bought her ticket well in advanced. And unfortunately the flu hit our family. And my wife is in able to travel due to having a high fever. American Airlines refused to give us any kind of credit and said that only those people with a positive Covid test will get sickness credits. Absolutely ridiculous. American Airlines wouldn’t work with us in any way so we had to eat the $500 for the plane ticket. I’m very sad for my wife and I’m even more disappointed in the quality of customer care American Airlines provides."
810,"✅ Trip Verified | My Flight from Fort Lauderdale to New York JFK was cancelled only 4 hours before my flight while I was on my way to the airport already. At the airport no one was able to tell me what was the reason for the cancellation. The weather at the time at the departure, transit and destination locations are all clear with no thunderstorm or even just rain. I noticed no other airlines had cancellations except American Airlines at that time. They gave me the replacement flight the next day from Miami instead. It seems to me that the reason for the arbitrary cancellation is simply there weren't that many passengers for this flight as I noticed at that time. That's compared to flight from Miami which was completely full. This is unprofessional and something that usually occurs in third world countries but not in USA. FAA should fine any airline that cancelled flights for no reason whatsoever and especially just to fill up seats in an otherwise less than full airplane and especially when they operate in US. Be careful with American Airlines."
811,✅ Trip Verified | I rebooked my flight on the phone for the same flight but different day at 6:15 am. And then it turned out that he booked 6 am flight. When I got to the airport only 1 person was at the ticket area and it took forever to get to her and then she told me that I should run and that I might not make it to the flight. I got to the gate and I wasn’t let into the aircraft cuz it was closed then I asked to put me on the flight that was leaving in 15 minutes so I could find different way. The agent made me stand there for 20 minutes. I told her that if she won’t help me then the next flight will be closed too. Of course few more minutes passed and then she started helping me and then said the other flight is closed now too. When initially I asked her for help people were still boarding. Then I got rebooked for 6 hours later flight. That was delayed twice. I saw that there is another flight leaving via different city so I asked for help. The lady didn’t want to help me. I said later this flight will close so I get stuck. Of course 10 minutes later different person is helping me and the first woman says I am closing this flight now. I told her but I asked you to help me and she said that she is closing it. Total nightmare and short staffing and incompetent people. Never again!
812,"Not Verified |  I had two connecting flights booked for my trip home. On the first flight, they were asking people to switch to a later flight for monetary compensation, so I offered. They added me to the next flight as a “backup” but ended up not needing me to switch, but they never took me off that new flight. I get on this first flight with no issues, but when I don’t show up for the second one (that shouldn’t have been booked at this point) they flag it as a “no-show” and cancel all upcoming flights on that trip — my second flight home that night AND my two flights back later that week. At this point I had no idea this was happening because my boarding pass was still visible on the app for all my flights. At the second airport, I had my boarding pass in the app readily available, walked up to the gate to scan it, and the gate agent stated that my ticket was cancelled and my seat had already been given to someone else. He claimed that I cancelled it myself in the app, which I 100% did not do and never received an email, text, notification, etc that my ticket was cancelled. Luckily they were able to squeeze me on the last flight of the night, but I was panicking thinking I was gonna have to spend the night in a strange city I’ve never been to before! The gate agents were not very empathetic to my situation. I spoke with the representative on the help line who was unable to help me, so I filed a complaint with corporate who also blamed the entire situation on me and was no help. This entire experience left a very bad taste in my mouth and I would warn anyone booking with this airline!"
813,"✅ Trip Verified |  Service was terrible. We were 6 fully paid passengers with 2 infants. Four adults, 4 children ages 5, 3, 1 and 1. Bought AA tickets through the AA website roundtrip San Diego - Helsinki. We called about a week in advance and added the two infants to the 6 paid tickets itinerary. Agent said all was fine. Check in at SAN took about 2 hours at the counter while the agent tried to add the infants to our group. Paid for the infants and finally was told all was done, booked through the roundtrip. Tried to board at 10:00 pm the codeshare Finnair in NY JFK and was told the infants had no tickets. Finnair said that AA didn't transfer to infants' tickets to Finnair. Went to AA desk and they tried to do the transfer but couldn't before the flight left. We waited at the AA desk from 10:00 PM to 1:30 AM while they tried to do this transfer. We had four young children in a very uncomfortable situation during this wait. About 11:00 PM I asked the agent to just process the hotel stay, since that was obviously necessary, so we could get the children to sleep. The agent was surly, and insisted that she finish the ticket transfer process first. This was not finished until 1:30 AM, and we were very distressed and unhappy. To make matters worse the local AA manager insisted it was Finnair's problem while the AA agent who finally got it transferred acknowledged it to be AA's fault. Every AA agent we interacted with was rude and unhelpful for our situation. On our return out of Helsinki only one of the infants' tickets was in the system, and it took hours and calls to AA tech support while we waited at the Finnair checkin counter to get this fixed. Luckily we didn't miss the flight because we got to the airport at 4:30 AM, 3 hours before the flight. When I buy a codeshare ticket through AA I expect them to be responsible for their process through the codeshare. Finnair told us this was a frequent situation in dealing with AA. I don't know why I or anybody for whom I buy tickets for should ever fly AA again."
814,"✅ Trip Verified |  It's been a decade or so since I've flown AA. The trip out, which I am not reviewing here, added 3 hours to our travel time which was a guessing game of, ""will we or won't we"". The trip back was the doozy. We had a flight scheduled for 3 months. All locked up with seats selected and all. On the day of our travel home from Eagle, CO airport, we received a notice via the AA app that the flight was delayed and that we MUST choose another connecting flight because we'd miss our Chicago O Hare connection. So we do and the flight that was chosen via the app actually took us to DC instead of MD. We called to correct this item and that transfer only took 26 minutes on the phone. At this time, we were on the hour long bus ride to the airport to catch our now confirmed 240pm flight. As SOON as we got that confirmation, we checked the app immediately and there was another delay 2:40 to 4:02pm We figured, ""okay, things happen but let's make the most of it"". We waited at the Eagle airport for 5 hours before the notifications started flying. Delayed again to 5pm. Again, looking like we'd miss our connecting flight again but then reassured by the staff at the check in desk that we'd be fine. I brought up that there seemed to be confusion with the app and the information that they had. Again, reassured that we'd be fine. The time finally rolled around to board and this same attendant came running up to us to apologize about the information she shared a half hour ago. We would in fact, likely not make our connecting flight. So, we took this flight anyway. Got to the airport and the plane taxied for a half hour to get to our terminal (this included wait time for a spot to open?). We asked the check in attendant if we could get to the next gate before they left, he said we could. He didn't offer to radio ahead to hold the door for 5 minutes or anything. We ran. And I mean, almost had a heart attack ran to go the 20 gates to make the flight. They were pulling away as we showed up. The first time I've ever seen a plane pull away from the concourse on time ironically. The desk attendant of course couldn't help us because all flights out of Texas apparently stop at 730pm? I expressed my displeasure with the fact that everyone would tell us there were delays, rarely did anyone know what system was disclosing the delays to customers and that no one could tell us why there were so many delays. We were told ,""weather"". Not where the weather was bad but that there was ""weather"". Eagle was 28 degrees with blue skies and jets were taking off left and right. Texas was 65 degrees and Maryland was in the teens with no snow or ice. We were offered the very last flight out of Dallas but it would get us in to DC at 2am. We reluctantly accepted with confirmation of a ride from one of our good friends. Otherwise, we were stuck in a motel and another connecting flight through Charlotte to BWI. The airlines are crumbling but this was just horrendous. We were not the only ones affected this day by AA. Nor will we be the last."
815,"✅ Trip Verified | Yet again, American Airlines, delivers on their abhorrent customer service. I haven’t flown with them in over 6 years due to constant issues with flights (delays, last minute changes or cancellations - usually due to their error). I recently decided to fly with them due to someone else picking up the tab and they re-affirmed why I stopped flying with them. They cancelled my red eye via text last minute. I had to call and fight to get them to change it to one with Delta that would work with my schedule (4 hours longer). When I asked for any customer service, I was told I chose this flight so they aren’t liable. They told me that all they’re responsible for is getting me to my destination, but apparently they get to choose the time and flight for me ultimately."
816,"✅ Trip Verified | As I was landing in Phoenix to catch the final Let of my return home, I received a text that my flight from Phoenix to Orange County (Santa Ana) was cancelled. There were no other options to fly into Southern California. American did the right thing by providing a hotel. But their system failed to provide a transportation voucher to the hotel (no airport transportation offered by the hotel according to the AA information). The real insult was that I landed at 7.30pm local time. I can’t fly out till tomorrow morning. I was speaking with an AA agent. AA gave me a $12 (twelve dollar) voucher for Dinner or Breakfast! Are you serious? What airport or hotel offers a nutritious, filling meal for $12 (including tax and tip)? I had the agent contact the customer sat depart three times during our conversation. AA refused to give more than $12. I am a Platinum For Life AA customer (over 2 million lifetime miles) and this is how they thank me for all the business I have given them? If Airlines show no loyalty, how can they expect any from customers? I am beyond disappointed."
817,"Not Verified | Absolute worst airline experience, I never thought it could be so bad. They delayed several times and cancelled my connecting flight. Set me up with a hotel, I wasn’t able to have my checked baggage, but the agent at customer service assured me that I needed to get a ticket in the AM for the next flight to Denver. I’m the morning I received 3 texts delaying my flight to Denver. When I showed up for the scheduled flight the lady at customer service said that the flight I was supposed to take already took off in the morning, when I showed her the texts I received she said she didn’t know why I got those. She was able to get me a flight later that day, which was delayed once again. Then at the gate they said that the flight was full so I had to check in my carry on bag, I was already down another from the previous flight."
818,"✅ Trip Verified | Pay for first class ticket, delay after delay. Go to the rest room, they board and close the gate ahead of what was said, they left several people standing there clueless for us to go figure it out. I hate this airline, will never fly with them again."
819,"✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines are the worst, my first flight was delayed over 2 hours, as a result I missed my connection flight. And they don’t have another flight until tomorrow morning at 8.50am. I am so annoyed and will never use them again. When complained to customer service, they look at you like you’re crazy. Worst customer service."
820,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review isn't so much about American Airlines as it is about a flight attendant. As we all know, since 911, and more recently Covid, traveling has changed in countless ways. However, one flight attendant, Jan, brought back the joy of flying on my flight from Portland to Dallas. From her greeting upon boarding & throughout the flight, she was professional, kind, personable, attentive to the souls on board, and always with a beautiful smile. It felt as though the years had slipped away, and we were once again in a time when our world had not been forever changed. Thank you, Jan. And thank you American Airlines for having such an amazing person working for you!! The flight was 2655 on Wednesday, January 25th - I was seated in 21C."
821,Not Verified |  They closed the cabin door and didn’t take off till an hour later. They directed me to another flight and they also didn’t take off till an hour later. They could have easily let me get on the first flight. I had to wait three hours for the second flight to take off. Horrible.
822,"Not Verified |  As of right now, I am sitting on this plane. We have a connecting flight in Charlotte to Miami, we have been sitting here on this flight for 30-45 minutes with little to no movement. After rushing us onto the flight and telling us we were going to be leaving shortly, we are still here. We are not being told what is going on or how much longer this will be taking place or how long this delay is becoming. It’s terrible. The pilot even acknowledged that we had a connecting flight they didn’t want us to miss. Too little, too late. Will not fly American again."
823,"Not Verified |  We paid for a first class ticket and had chosen our seats when booking since we were traveling with a baby. They changed our seats the day before our flight without us knowing so that we were separated and then when our flight was delayed, we got bumped to coach with no refund."
824,"Not Verified |  Due to our flight being late we missed our connecting flight. There were no more flights for 3 days. We had to sleep in the airport overnight. We went standby the next morning and were lucky to get on the flight. However, the gate person upgraded 4 people to first class and gave our first class seats to them and we had to sit in coach with no food. We are AA members and fly first class. We paid for first class and got coach. We have called, and submitted refund request three times and still have not heard anything. We should not have to pay the first class fees given we were not provided the service. We are very dissatisfied."
825,"Not Verified |  Third class airline. My Boarding card showed Gate no. 27, When I reached, I saw no one, Then I asked a crew member they sent me to D4 Terminal, When I reached there, they again sent me to D11 gate and said because of the system they are changing the gate. When I reached, they closed the gate and the flight was gone by that time. I had to catch another flight. I went to American airline counter, The lady was so rude on D Terminal. When I requested for help she stopped me in a conversation and said ""if you use one more word I am not going to help you, then said why didn't you choose another airline and finally she totally damaged my whole route. I was in Miami with no help, No hotels no food they gave me. Then Qatar airways helped me and said American airlines cancelled my whole route when they were reissuing my ticket. I had so much trouble that I never faced. I have travelled many countries with different airlines. I think American Airlines crews learn from any Asian countries airlines how to deal with customer, behavior and hospitability. Never forget, We pay for the service, not granted. "
826,"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight was delayed, overcrowded and overpriced ($700 for a domestic flight with one connection, booked several months in advance of the trip). My checked bag was broken when I retrieved it from the baggage carousel at O'Hare, One wheel was snapped off and the hard shell was broken so that the foam underneath shows through and it's unusable. The baggage helpdesk filed a report and gave me a receipt and told me to wait for the claim to be processed. I waited and then tried to follow up with a claim submission online but the American Airlines site isn't working. When I tried to fill in a claim amount, the form is stuck on '0.00'. American Airlines also expects a receipt for the purchase of my suitcase (who keeps those)? The claim should be for replacement not for original purchase. Then I tried calling customer service and never got through. I finally talked to customer service in January '23 was told that the 30 day limit for claims has expired. I did as advised and think that American Airlines make the claims process so impossible that they are not accountable for any damage. Avoid this airline if you can."
827,"✅ Trip Verified |  The customer service we experienced during this flight was so awful, that I will pay double to fly a different airline in the future. Our flight was delayed several hours, then canceled, then rescheduled a day later. Connecting flights were missed with the customer help people emailing us wrong information for our rebooked flights. This took over an hour on the phone at 02:00. We found out we were not actually booked on our next rebooked connecting flight when we got to the gate to board. We were not given updates by text or email, bounced around between American and their subsidiaries, told we couldn’t be helped, sent all over the airport to be told there was nothing they could do. No one cares, with an employee telling us American Airlines is the lowest paying airline. AA doesn’t care, your employees don’t care. I regret giving your company thousands of dollars for the worst service I’ve ever experienced and losing a couple precious days of our trip. You should be embarrassed by this representation of your company. The worst thing about this is what we’ve lost, time, which is irreplaceable."
828,"✅ Trip Verified | I've had roughly 60+ flights a year for the past 10 years for work. I've learned from the past to avoid American. They delay more than any other airline to the point it is beyond obnoxious and inconvenient. I will opt for longer trips, more expensive trips, and whatever else to avoid. From what I've heard, they have poor management which aggravates employees. They then take it put on us by creating delays by using any little rule they can find to make life worse for us. Recently I've flown AA from SHV to SAT and ONT to MAF. The first was canceled. The second was delayed to the point I missed my connection and have to find a hotel. Avoid them at absolutely all costs. Hopefully they go bankrupt so someone worth something can pick them up out of insolvency."
829,"✅ Trip Verified |  When preparing myself for arrival the flight attendant told me my seat back needed to go up. I informed her that I had pressed the button a few times and the seat back wasn’t moving. Then she watched as I pressed it again, still with no movement. She did nothing to help me but give me the “death glare,” as my surrounding seat group named it. Then the couple sitting behind me pushed the back of my chair up but it still wasn’t moving. Still no help from the flight attendant, just that rude annoyed face. Finally the seat went up, she just walked away annoyed. If you don’t like helping people then don’t work in a customer service industry. It is so unpleasant to be treated poorly, when you are actively working to help the situation."
830,"Not Verified |  
Paid $4200 for first class lie flat seats on flights to Hawaii. On both outgoing and incoming flights my first class seat was broken. On return flight there were a total of 3 seats that were broken. We were not notified, not given a refund or anything. Staff was extremely rude as we were told 'oh well', 'I'm sure someone in coach would be happy to take your seat' and that 'you were supposed to be notified'. We filed a complaint with AA and were only offered $150 credit on one flight and $400 credit for the other. The tickets cost $4200! Clearly AA is not maintaining their fleet and it shows. A gate agent told us that they just keep flying the planes back and forth with them not fixed. Will never fly first class on AA again."
831,✅ Trip Verified |  I will never fly with American Airlines again. They closed boarding early and would not let me on the plane. They told me that 200 other people heard over the PA that they were closing boarding early and that I should have been paying attention. They booked me on the next flight but refused to print out a boarding pass for me so I had to go back to ticketing and through TSA again. I was booked as an economy passenger despite paying for a first class ticket and the flight had first class seats available. Horrible customer service and you can’t rely on their policies.
832,"✅ Trip Verified |  How not to be welcomed on to the plane by a hostess. Boarded flight from Maui to LA to be greeted by the air hostess say to both my sister and I ‘have you got a blanket to cover up?’, which we replied ‘No’, as apparently our sunburn was ‘going to hurt with the cold air conditioning there was on the plane’. This left both of us feeling very unwelcomed and feeling very worthless, despite us both being a priority and member of the one world frequent flyer programme - also thinking who is she to judge whether I’ve got a sunburn or not, when she doesn’t even know me. Clearly they have no idea how to treat their customers, let alone their frequent flyer members. In all my time of flying, I have never been spoken to in a very rude & personal way. "
833,"✅ Trip Verified |  Don't fly with America Airlines. Ordered tickets with their agent on phone to make sure that my parents (81 with Parkinson's and 85 with cancer) would have seats that could lay down for the 10 hour flight. My husband and I in main cabin. Because my parents don't know how to you the internet and check in online. My mom with Parkinson's was bumped back. My father took her seat, so he got no rest. My mom needed someone to help her and no one was there.  Customer service is well that is our policy. Sorry you had a bad trip. No ticket with AA guarantees your seat. They can change or kick you off at any time."
834,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very smooth flight, left and arrived on time. Staff makes a more professional impression than United. On board entertainment is pretty limited, but works well."
835,✅ Trip Verified |  Flight 533 was supposed to take off at 6.56pm however it has now been delayed to 11.30pm because there is no pilot. Not only is this unacceptable but the Supervisor and his co-worker took my bag with my asthma medication and put it under the plane and refused to give it back to me stating it was too late.
836,Not Verified |  Paid 30 bucks to check my suitcase. Not only was it an entire day late due to the fact they never shipped it to my house like they promised. So I had to drive 45 minutes in the rain to get my suitcase. When I arrived I discovered that two of the four wheels have been smashed. Not just the wheels themselves but they’ve been smashed through the plastic shell of my suitcase. So now I have to buy a new suitcase. Deplorable beyond belief. Who knew that it only costs 30 bucks for America Airlines to destroy your baggage. I filed a complaint but they chose to ignore it.
837,"Not Verified | Will never fly American Airlines again. Ground staff at Nashville’s check in counter were so rude, made snarky comments and were blatantly disrespectful. My Southwest flight was cancelled and only AA had availability for the 1st. I’d rent a car and drive before flying American Airlines again. Do better American Airlines. Where do you find these people?"
838,"✅ Trip Verified | No delays with outbound flight to CUN; however, due to the winter storm front that resulted in flight cancellations/delays, are inbound flight to DFW was delayed by 6 1/2 hours. No fault of the airline. Every other air carrier was affected. To American Airlines credit, flash notifications via SMS kept us updated about the delays. Outbound flight was on a B777-200ER premium economy seat. Very comfortable plane with 2-4-2 seating. In bound flight was on 787-9 Dreamliner. Very comfortable premium economy seating. Kudos to the pilots and flight crew. The pilots on both outbound/inbound flights kept us apprised on a regular basis of when we would be out of turbulence caused by a major weather front that brought single digit bone chilling temperatures to North Texas. ICE worked just fine. Started one movie and finished same on inbound flight. Food and beverage is the typical service on domestic flights (snacks and soft drinks)."
839,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew to Boston from DFW (roundtrip) for a wedding in early December. There were no delays on either outbound or inbound flight. The pilots apprised the passengers of any potential delays. Both flights were smooth with very little turbulence encountered. Kudos to American Airlines. Flight crew was very polite and friendly. Outbound flight on A321 Premium Economy seat. Enough legroom for a comfortable flight. Bathrooms are smaller than on the 737-800. Inbound flight to DFW was on 737-800. The premium economy seat had plenty of legroom. Service is typical (biscotti, snack and soft drinks) of all domestic flights. No issues on either flight. ICE worked just fine. I do not understand the negativity expressed by other passengers. American does a pretty good job of getting you were you want on their domestic flights."
840,"✅ Trip Verified | Distance between gates is long without mass transit or enough moving sidewalks. Year-round, you have to exit the building, in all weather scenarios, and board a shuttle bus to terminals. This might not be so bad if the shuttle stopped at each terminal, but it does not, so wherever you need to go, there us still walking involved, sometimes back to the terminal you need but just drove past. When landing, American Airlines said they were holding connecting flights, but mine was gone (and left early, at that) when I reached the gate after having to wait for and then hop the shuttle bus. Then, when I wanted to go back, from terminal F to terminal B to get a hotel room, I was told the shuttle was closed for the night...it was not yet 9 pm. When I asked an AA manager for a ride on a cart from terminal F to terminal B, he denied my request. This is unacceptable for any airport to treat passengers in this manner, but really not a good look for the city of brotherly love! I was told that I would get a discount on the hotel, but Marriott (attached to the hotel at terminal B) did not honor it. I was told by airport personnel that there was a shuttle to the hotel, but when I called to make a reservation, I was told no shuttle. There is a shuttle, until 11 pm, but based on that info and information from another airport information clerk who said no hotel shuttle as well, I had to walk from terminal F to terminal B, not a short distance for a senior citizen and one who had already walked and shuttled several directions and terminals. For the most part, no one who worked in the airport or for AA seemed to care one iota! Also, I had paid for Priority boarding, but did not get this, flight was re-booked. Then, when arrived in Manchester, NH, no one in baggage office to get my bag from night before, and AA desk personnel told me to walk back and stand by the door, he'd be back soon. No one at AA in Manchester, NH seemed to care, either. Terrible experience overall!"
841,"Not Verified | We flew to Miami and then Panama on American Airlines, I usually travel with United and have travel status with United. I remembered why I do not like flying with American. The staff was very unfriendly and unprofessional at the airports in Savannah and Miami on the return. The flight in Savannah was delayed two hours, no fault of anyone there but the girl at the counter sat around on her phone and she could have had people put tags on their bags because it was a full small plane and instead she caused us to sit for an extra 45 min and the airline stewardess were annoyed at her and yelling at her and they all were arguing. The stewardess were absolutely right, she caused us to just barely make out flight to Panama which was the only one that day but unfortunately our bags did not make it. SO, we ended up stuck in Panama without any bags on Christmas eve. No clothes or toiletries and we could not leave to portobello like our travel plans called for. The next day, Christmas, I spent hours at the airport trying to find someone from AA to get me my bags that had come in on the flight. Literally one person working for the entire airlines. Unless it's the only airline going there, I will never fly with them again."
842,"✅ Trip Verified | Travelled with family: 2 adults and 3 children under 6 yrs old. Check in was ok, let us board via priority line as we had small kids. Airplane seating, etc was ok, main issue is with the cabin staff. Not very professional. They are very abrupt, condescending and do not really make an effort to help you. I will avoid this airline at all costs in the future."
843,"✅ Trip Verified | Today the ticket counter was fully staffed and quickly moved people along with their check-in and luggage. While there is plenty this airline has done poorly, this morning went smooth. Thank you."
844,"✅ Trip Verified | My initial flight was delayed and when I expressed concern, both at the gate and to the flight attendants, I got the brush off. “You’ll make it” they said. “Just run” they said. My connecting flight left early and they were zero help getting me to my final destination. They got me 3.5 hours away and had no suggestions or reimbursement for the rest of the miles. Other airlines I have been on would have prioritized my deplaning, had assistance to get me to the gate (across the entire airport, of course!) and maybe even held the plane for 2 minutes. But not American. No. Unbelievable."
845,"Not Verified | Cost me a hotel and a rental car that I had to get and drive 600 miles after you FAILED to get us to our connecting flight and then had NO SOLUTION. My Phx-Dallas flight was delayed three hours, causing a missed connecting flight and I was informed that there were no other flights that I could take home, and none the next day either. We missed our connecting flight because of this - If you insist on delaying flights by THREE HOURS, at least have some kind of solution for the customers. That's what professionals would do. I give credit to the aircrew, although they were late, they almost got us to Dallas in time to connect with the next flight, but then guess what? The airport ground crew decided they had no idea how to set up the Gate for passenger de-planing. Nice job!! Sat there for 45 minutes waiting on these staff who can't even execute the basics. The basics! So we can't even reasonably expect to de-plane the aircraft in less than 30 minutes anymore, and that is PATHETIC. Again, the aircrew did their part - they flew the plane - but still, three hours late, and the ground crew - complete FAIL. Airline industry, get your act together! Or you can count on losing more customers than you ever thought possible."
846,"✅ Trip Verified |  It’s really sad to be prejudged. I get complimentary upgrades because I fly quite frequently with American Airlines. I’m standing in the priority lane and an American airline staff member told me I needed to get out of the line and go where they are scanning in the bags, this is for first class. I told her I was first class. She should’ve checked the people in front of me, who actually didn’t belong in the line. But I’m going to assume it’s because I’m black and they were white."
847,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airline does not take accountability for the flight delays, rebooking and cancellations. I was rebooked for the next day due to a problem with the airline. No weather issues. I went to the rebooking center to find out what happened, and they stated their system automatically detects when they don't think you will make the connecting flight and rebook you. I advised the agent that I will need to make it home today. She stated if I booked with another airline, American should refund me for the return flight because it was not due to weather and due to American Airlines issue. When contacting American airline they are trying everything in their power to not give me my refund because they say I didn't call them the same day. I contacted them and I was advised to contact my booking agency (booking.com). So, I contacted my booking agency on 12/21/22 (the same day) advising them that I was being rebooked and needed to receive a refund. I reached back out to booking.com today 12/27/22 because I hadn't heard anything. Booking.com advised that I should call American and ask them to give booking.com the control of the ticket in order to refund me. When I called American Airlines, the agent basically told me to send an email to AA.com because it was nothing she could do. I can't believe they are taking no accountability for their wrongdoing. To make matters worse I have another booking with them for Jan 13th & 15th. After that, I will never fly American again. They are worse than Southwest. It's worth paying the extra to fly Delta Airline."
848,✅ Trip Verified |  This has been the worst flight ever. The plane broke down on the runway. The plane was returned to the gate . Flight were postponed 4 times after that. I had to sit in the airport for 9 hours.
849,"Not Verified |  The day before Thanksgiving, my grandson and I flew on American Airlines from Dallas, TX to Memphis, TN. Prior to boarding at the gate, our 1 piece of luggage was taken from us, and we were told there was no more room for carry on. Upon arriving in Memphis, I received a text from AA, stating that the luggage did not arrive with us. I talked to an AA customer service rep in the baggage claim area and was told that the luggage would arrive on Thanksgiving. The luggage arrived late on Thanksgiving as promised. When I opened my luggage, everything was soaked as if the luggage had been left out on the runway all night in the Dallas rain. I was only in Memphis for a couple of days to spend time with family, and I spent most of my time washing clothes so that we would have something clean to wear. When I arrived at the Dallas airport, I reported the incident to an AA CSR, and she printed out several forms for me to fill out and mail in. I tried to make a claim online, but the site was not user friendly and continue to ask for a claim number. I would recommend to anyone who has problems with missing or damage items in your luggage to file a claim within 24 hours, if not you may receive a generic letter asking you to file a claim with your travel insurance and that American Airlines will look forward to you flying with them again."
850,"Not Verified |  Day 1 Flight Cancelled, lost out on VRBO and 1 day in Mexico. Day 2. missed out on Mexico because day 2 was a nightmare and missed our connecting flight. Day 2 Flight delayed from 7:00 AM--6:00 PM. Had to install a new captain's chair and had to read a 300 page manual.  Had us board the plane for 2 hours and then deplane as the de-icer was not working. Get back on the plane at 6:00 PM and arrive at Dallas at 8:30 and lose our luggage. Talked to American Airline Rep and she PROMISED our luggage would be in Cozumel. Not the case Day 3--Flight gets delayed again and moves to a new flight. Supposed to land in Dallas on time and make a connecting flight. No chance in hell with this airline. Get 20 minutes from Dallas and the captain says that he lost our navigation system and have to land in Tulsa, OK. Keep us on the plane for more than 4 hours. Wait for another plane and get off the plane outside and board another flight to Dallas. Arrive in Dallas at 11:45 PM and miss out on another flight. Take a taxi and book a room. After booking a room American Airlines sends us a text with hotel vouchers and the hotel won't take the voucher because we already paid. Day 4 Flight gets delayed and finally get back home. "
851,"Not Verified |  Worst experience ever, terrible customer service flight delayed more than 9+ hours and they keep postponing departure. No clear reason on why all this is happening everyone frustrated, seat was not clean when I boarded and luggage not onboard captain is saying another 45 min extra to finish. Seriously how can they be this bad? Please don’t fly with AA, fly with someone else!"
852,"✅ Trip Verified |  It is impossible to book baggage on this route until you check in, never ever had this problem with any other airline. I found the baggage information online to be quite misleading and confusing. I approached ground staff the evening before my flight as I was staying at the hotel located in Miami airport, they were rude and unhelpful. They were not interested in helping me. The following day the check in agent was helpful and did a good job in assisting me. Ultimately I won’t fly AA again as there are far better airlines out there."
853,"✅ Trip Verified | I have flown with American Airlines numerous times over the years. I am an Aviator Mastercard member and AA Advantage member but my experience with American Airlines over the past four days has completely changed my opinion of them. My flight home for the holidays was cancelled and they refused to return my baggage to me when I requested it immediately. I waited for my bags for two hours the night it was cancelled then was told to return the next morning. I went the next morning and requested my bag to be pulled, waited 6 hours and still no bag. Was told I’d be called once they found it. Heard nothing for three days then after calling around, I found out today my bag was sent to Omaha even though I never flew. Now I’m having to figure out how to get my baggage home to me without being lost again. This experience completely destroyed our holiday plans and the entire weekend. Throughout this whole experience it was impossible to get ANYONE from American to assist me in finding my baggage. The AA workers at the Charlotte baggage claim office were confrontational, unfriendly, insensitive and caused total chaos among all of the worried travelers. There were several other travelers in line beside me needing vital medications from their luggage and the staff showed no remorse, offering zero effort in trying to assist them. These people were told that this should be a “lesson” not to put medication in your checked bag!! I am so disappointed in the lack of assistance, communication and service that I had grown to expect from American Airlines. I don’t say this to be rude, I share this so that things can be addressed and changed so others don’t experience this in the future. Thank you."
854,"Not Verified |  Booked a flight for a daughters wedding. Had a medical emergency. Was in emergency hospital for 7 hours. Doctor recommended no travel. (Copy of letter was sent to AA at their request). AA refused to refund flight. Competition for flight down was on Alaska Airlines. They made a refund immediately. The cost of the ticket for AA was also about 60% more than Alaska Airlines. Had to book on AA for 1/2 the trip due to scheduling. Highly recommend Alaska Airlines, and NOT American Airlines. I am 82 years old"
855,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight was cancelled because their de-icing machine was broken. Two days later the flight was again cancelled because they only have one deicing machine. This is a northern city, it is unbelievable they only have a single deicing machine and they cannot fix it in two days."
856,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to Utah on December 23rd. It is now December 26th and my luggage just arrived in Utah. I have tried contacting the airline several times and could not speak to a real person. So I went on the app to chat with an airline employee and got a message that said that the wait to chat was over 2 hours. Well, over 12 hours later I got a notification on my phone that it was almost my turn and I finally got an update on my luggage. And though the airline offered to deliver the bag, the wait time for delivery was at least a week. So I have to drive an hour back to the airport to get my bag. I submitted receipts for the clothes I had to buy and I will be shocked if they actually reimburse me. Unreal."
857,"Not Verified | Overall, four very disappointing flights with American Airlines in First Class. We few MIA -LAX-HNL-LAX-MIA. All were disappointing. Our biggest complaint were the so called First Class seats, frankly I have sat in better and more comfortable seats on an economy flight in Asia. Little legroom, no footrest and a very minimal recline. I am 6' 4 ' and it was impossible to get comfortable and certainly not possible to sleep. We were not allowed to use any lounge despite being in First Class for all legs unless we paid $59.00 for a day pass. The lounges were nothing special and in LAX the ground personnel took pleasure in telling us that the showers were not available to passengers. Boarding all airports was a joke. When the flights are called all passengers surge forward and all the ground staff do is just accept the boarding passes, no control or finesse whatsoever. On board meals were so, so. Nothing exciting and certainly not served with any enthusiasm or pleasure. Only one round of drinks offered on a five hour flight, fortunately we had taken our own water on board. I would urge any future potential American passenger to be very careful and check what type of aircraft will be used, the A321 is a nice aircraft but the AA First Class cabin should be avoided, its just not worth the money. We will not fly American again. Overall an awful experience."
858,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my third time flying American Airlines this month and my first time flying in a business class cabin since they reinstated full service and my experience was excellent. Since we had a short taxi, the pre-departure beverage was not offered. However, once we got up in the air it was quickly served with warm mix nuts. For dinner we had a delicious beef dinner with macaroni and cheese, a mixed salad, a small side shrimp aperitive, warm rolls, and a little ice cream tub for dessert. If you watch a small commercial, you’re even got 20 minutes of free, high-speed Internet, which was enough for me to send a few messages. The airplane was only six years old and very well-kept. I really don’t understand what all the negative comments are about, three times on AmericanAirlines in one month, and I have had very positive experiences. I will fly them again soon."
859,"Not Verified | $30 for checked bag, $3 for curbside service, $100 dollars for bag 12 pounds over. And that's one way. What a racket. Going back to Jetblue."
860,"✅ Trip Verified |  I purchased my own $3000 battery powered wheelchair so I don’t have to use the airlines (& other places) wheelchairs. My chair is FAA approved but yet I was detained for multiple hours, left in cue or the gangway while they made mechanical repairs to the plane. I had no access to food, water or a bathroom. I was forced out of my chair because they said my battery was not safe to fly. I was told I might not be allowed to board if I did not remove the battery from my chair. When I responded that I’ve never had to remove it (hence, the fact that it’s affixed to the frame with screws & the cord is all wrapped around the frame with flex ties), that I was not physically capable of removing along with the lack of knowledge to comply with their request. A man said “if you keep refusing to cooperate, we are going to deny you boarding”. I was not refusing, I simply was telling the truth & pointing out the obvious. I was never disrespectful to any staff. I am a disabled veteran diagnosed with PTSD/MST & chronic pain from an injury to my knees while serving in support of Desert Storm. I also have allergies & asthma. Asthma that is usually triggered by animals, flowers or pollen in the air. After I was allowed to board, I saw 7 cats & dogs pass by me. My eyes were already burning just from that. So I inquired what my rights were regarding those animals & my allergies because I could tell it was going to be an issue. After 14 days on a ship, all we wanted to do was go home & I had done a miraculous job of orchestrating everything so there would be no hold up anywhere. An AA employee got down face level with me & whispered in my ear that if I kept pursuing the allergy thing & insisting that I might need aid (ie oxygen) if I have an asthma attack from the animals & my rescue inhaler does not do the trick, that they will remove me from the flight. She said I suggest you take another mask from them & put it over your mask, turn your air vent on & or you won’t be flying. AA turned a 9 hour day into 27 hours, rebooked me to be stuck overnight in an airport, taking a whole other day to get to my destination & offered me no accommodation, reimbursement for or even a food voucher. Other people on the flight got vouchers but not me. I checked in with 3 bags & I’m 4 days after check in to the original nightmare flight & I’m still missing a bag with all of our brand new clothes in it.  Can’t get anybody on the phone to tell me where it is or when it might be here.  I do not recommend flying this airline."
861,Not Verified |  Both of our planes to Dallas and from Dallas had an hour long delay! Our morning flight from Cancun at 7 got delayed. How is the first flights of the morning encountering long delays? American Airlines sucks and needs to get more airplanes if all of them are going to need maintenance everyday. Tired of waiting for hours at the airport and missing our connecting flights all because American Airlines is unprepared!
862,"Not Verified |  We booked our flight 17 weeks prior to our vacation in Curaçao (lay over in Miami). The flight on American Airlines had a 6am departure. It was later changed to 7:05am … which gave us a 87 minute window to get to our flight to next flight at gate D40. We did not depart from ORD until 7:56. There was no explanation except that the food truck was unloading their goods. We arrived at gate D4 with less than twenty five minutes to make our gate. We were at back of the plane full of passengers. An announcement was made by flight stewards that those not pressed to make a connection should allow those that did have a connection be given deplaning priority. That was the last of any help by the apathetic airline staff. They just stood around making small talk. First, there was no weather related issue to delay departure. Plane was not arriving from anywhere else. We were sited almost at the very rear of the plane when itinerary was clear that we had a connection gate a distance away. My wife and I ran (even with a recent need replacement for my 76 year old knee). The airline staff was rude, apathetic, and lazy. There was little assistance. It was like “ we have your money, you are on your own). The return flight was as bad with the agent giving us the wrong boarding passes, causing immigration to detain us. Then our arrival at Miami-Dade was chaos. With immigration, baggage exchange, two sky trains and a mile and a half travel, we just made our flight. One, I will avoid AA. Two, I will avoid Miami Dade airport. Three, there appears to be a real lack of any customer service or consideration by American Airlines."
863,✅ Trip Verified |  If you want your flight delayed or canceled book American Airlines. This was an absolutely terrible experience. My flight was delayed for over an hour. Tons of peoples flights canceled all in time for Christmas.
864,"✅ Trip Verified | The worst trip my daughter had to experience from this airline. They stopped the pilots from flying due to them almost going over there flying hours, the worst part is they put the pilot in a nice hotel and put there customers in a nasty run down hotel (shame on American Airlines. A billion dollars company treating there customers this way especially when they had to cancel and accommodate them. My daughter couldn’t sleep and cried all night. Will not fly with American Airlines again. "
865,"Not Verified |  It’s difficult to describe how bad American Airlines is. Utter chaos Dec 19 2022. Flight delayed with the famous rolling thirty minute delays. Changed to another flight. Plane taken out of set due to mechanical issues. Wait for new plane with zero communication from gate staff. “You know as much as we do. You’ll know when the new plane is coming when we do.”. Again, rolling delays. Original flight that was delayed ended up being delayed four times. Just awful gate staff. No help from AA customer service. You cannot count on anything they tell you. . Finally get to Cancun and missed our shuttle. Spent $70 for a taxi. Again. Difficult to describe how poorly this airline is run."
866,"Not Verified | We flew round trip from Tennessee to Texas, having a layover in Charlotte. We were headed to my step mother’s funeral. EVERY SINGLE FLIGHT WAS OVER AN HOUR LATE. We arrived at Charlotte on the way to Texas. What should’ve been a 2.5 hr layover ended up being 3.5 hr layover. We arrived to Texas late and had to stay two hours after we landed to hunt our luggage that was left in Charlotte. It took forever for us to get a placement on our luggage and when we would receive it. A lady in customer service over the phone assisted us quickly but everyone before her played the blame game and said there was little to be done. By the time we tracked the LATE plane carrying our luggage, WE MISSED THE FUNERAL. On the way back to Tennessee, our plane was 2 hr late which made us miss our final plane that was scheduled to land at 3:55pm. We now are waiting to board a flight that’s scheduled to board at 10:25pm. Each flight should’ve been no more than 4/5 hr total but ended up being an all day travel. I WILL NEVER FLY WITH THEM EVER AGAIN! I heard this has happened several times prior; but against my better judgement, I wanted to give them a try. Not to mention, they double charged us for a flight that we’ve not received credit back for; and the people working boarding desk are extremely rude. The only reason I’m giving them a 1 star is because it ring allow me to rate them at a zero."
867,"✅ Trip Verified | This is the absolute worst airline, please save your money and book with literally anyone else. I booked a flight with American to attend my best friends college graduation. Departing flight was delayed 12 hours due to the plane being out of service with no replacement. On my returning flight, we were told the plane was on time, then delayed, then on time. After all passengers were boarded and the gate was closed, we sat for 30 minutes, only to be told that our plane would not be leaving, we were to de-plane, and that we were not leaving until the next day. The story was that they “didn’t assign” a maintenance check to ensure safety to fly earlier in the day. (11.30am departure the following day when initially scheduled for 10.25pm departure) makes no sense, American is terrible. Take your money elsewhere."
868,✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines kept delaying my flight. What was the purpose of paying extra to change for a early flight when it still got delayed. My main issue was the female gate agent having an attitude when asked to be assisted on a flight that was leaving sooner and wasn’t full.
869,"✅ Trip Verified |  Even with a five hour delay due to staffing issues, American Airlines did a fabulous job. There is really nothing to complain about when you’re flying onboard a 6 year old Boeing 787 in a premium economy seat for the price of an “extra legroom” seat on a domestic flight. The onboard crew was very polite and friendly and the ground staff was wonderful during this five hour delay. As we entered the plane they apologized to each individual passenger, and even issued everyone who asked a meal voucher. Once up in the air, the Captain apologized to everyone onboard over the PA system and even got us to Philadelphia ahead of the protected time of arrival. As someone who is constantly flying, the way American Airlines handled this entire delay was fantastic, I don’t understand what all that negative complaining is about. Good job, American Airlines!"
870,"✅ Trip Verified |  When it comes to being unreliable, no one does it better than American Airlines.  My flight kept getting delayed by several hours and then we boarded. However, I’m not sure why we boarded because there were no available pilots for another hour. This Airline had customers buying tickets but didn’t allocate the proper number of pilots to meet demand. I get home several hours late because of the business model of this company. This should not be allowed. This should not be legal. Seriously AA, get your act together if you’re going to sell us these overpriced tickets. I will never again fly American Airlines."
871,"Not Verified |  It is obvious American Airlines has prioritized business strategy over customer service, so just be transparent with customers about that. Seating was cramped but passable (I’m 6’2” so this is always an issue for me). Staff couldn’t be bothered to seem interested in their job and were very dismissive to patrons. Both of those things are excusable as I understand the nature of long flights and shoddy scheduling/staffing on the part of their management. The part that made this one of the worst flights of my life was the food. The food was worse than anything I’ve eaten in the field as a military member (and I’ve spent weeks at a time without hot meals) or even school cafeteria. Their only redemption was Bejeweled and Tetris on the in flight games to distract me. If American Airlines considers themselves the new Spirit or Omni Air, then just say that so I can manage my own expectations. After this flight I’m telling anyone and everyone I know to do their best to take any other airline if they want a quality experience."
872,"✅ Trip Verified |  Everything from check in thru security to boarding went very smoothly. In flight services were very good. Seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment operated perfectly. This was an afternoon flight so there were only 2 selections for lunch. Both were cold plates but they were tasty and plentiful. Overall, my experience was very good. It was about a 2 1/2 hour flight and it went quickly. Cabin crew was very attentive to all passengers in my section of the plane."
873,"✅ Trip Verified |  American airlines is hands-down the worst airline from a First World country. I vowed never to fly them once before, and after many years I decided to fly them again. My bags were lost for five days and they couldn’t find them even though we had a tracker in the bag telling us exactly where the bags were. On my flight home, I was met with the most ridiculous set of circumstances that prevented me from using my miles to upgrade from premium economy to business. They had the inventory, they just wouldn’t do it because apparently the premium economy ticket I bought wasn’t the right type of ticket. After spending an hour and 10 minutes on the phone, I was connected to a supervisor who repeatedly talked over me to repeat herself telling me why they could not upgrade me. These people are terrible. "
874,"✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines took me from Philadelphia to Las Vegas safely and on time. The airplane was only a year and a half old and smelled like new. You know that you are a little bit more tighter inside these new planes however the design is such that you don’t really feel it, the mood lighting really helps and this five hour flight was good and time went fast. For $9.99 you can purchase Internet for the duration of the flight, I did and the Internet was very good. The crew was professional and friendly, since the flight was not full, they went around the plane to rearrange passengers, two per row instead of three, something I thought was very nice of them to take the time and do. They went around twice with free beverages and a snack, I was only expecting them to go around once. Overall a very positive experience for me compared to other carriers that fly this same route. "
875,"✅ Trip Verified |  Was disappointed to learn that Qatar Airways was partnering with American Airlines since previous experience with American Airlines was mediocre. But my return trip turned horrendous with the worst customer service possible at my SFO connection. Qatar was delayed, so I missed my connection but the worst part was American Airlines customer service. Although mid afternoon she began by saying to take my big bag and come back in the morning. When I began to explain my situation, she angrily said ""I do not want to talk to you! I reminded her that Qatar was their partner and her service would prevent customers from using American Airlines in the future, and she snapped ""I don't care!"" Never again will I fly on American Airlines. It's customer service is horrible."
876,"Not Verified |  I was flying with my siblings home from Arizona after our mom had passed away. We were tired, very emotional, and sad after an exhausting week. Upon checking in and letting them know we had our mothers remains we were shocked at the horrible customer service we received. I had called to see if there were any requirements to fly with remains and was told yes! Various paperwork had to be obtained, remains must be in carry on , etc. We followed all instructions only to find out upon check in “they didn’t care about any of that!” We were also told we could put remains in our checked bag so I did that, of course not wanting to carry an urn on the plane. The women checking us in was extremely rude. She never said sorry for your loss or anything. She then weighed my bag after she told to put the urn in my checked bag and charged me $100 extra for being 6 lbs over. When I asked about the price she said ""well you can start taking stuff out but good luck with it"". I wasn’t going to argue and just told her I would call when I got home. I did call and was told “ oh well that’s the policy for overweight baggage “ The employees have no empathy or sympathy! I will never fly with them again and neither will my family after the way we were treated!"
877,"Not Verified |  American failed to have a pilot ready for our flight, delaying the flight overnight literally as we started to board. Could not service us hotel or food vouchers at the gate because of ""technical difficulties"" but it appeared to be more employee incompetence. Further proof of that incompetence; their customer service counter told me I could claim diapers and wipes at the same counter I could claim a car seat, on the other side of Sky Harbor and down a level, just for me to find out that that was not true and no such supplies would be made available to me. The employees only suggestion was that I go out and get my own and request reimbursement. I am left stranded in a city hundreds of miles from home with none of my belongings and no way to acquire basic hygiene supplies for my infant without going out into the city on my own dime at 10 o'clock at night with an exhausted toddler in tow. The absolute worst fight experience I have ever had. The first and last time I will fly American, and I will tell all who will listen to stay away as well. Their pathetic offering of a food voucher included $12 a person and did not include my child. $48 dollars to feed a family of 5 for their own incompetence. Absolutely pathetic from start to finish. Stay away."
878,"Not Verified |  Had a horrible experience with the ground airline staff from this airline. She requested us riding the coach to check in our hand carry bags claiming that the overhead cabins were full which we totally understand. We had 2 of our hand carries checked in, and one of us did not have any hand carry. But that woman insisted and just tagged the bag that we wanted to take in with us, I believe that if every passenger is entitled to 1 hand carry it shouldn't be a problem. My problem is when we went inside the plane there were open spaces in the luggage cabin, I say this because I was one of the last people to get inside and the cabins are still open, and some people behind me were able to bring in theirs. At the end of the flight again some people have big bags, so where is the fairness when they claim to give the best service to the public."
879,"✅ Trip Verified | This airline is awful. If you can get a flight with anyone else, do it. I had a layover, set by the airline, and by the time I got off my first flight my second had already left. They then couldn’t put me on the next flight, five hours later (which they also overbooked), so had to put me on the flight after that another seven hours later. I am about to miss a funeral because this airline couldn’t follow through with what I paid them for. If you value your time and money NEVER fly with American Airlines."
880,✅ Trip Verified |  I was treated so poorly yesterday by the manager of American Airlines that I will never be returning as a customer. I frequently fly with my Bichon Frise and I was told he was not allowed to go on the flight. The Manager took pleasure in telling me that. She smiled and laughed while I teared up. I was trying to see my family for the holidays. It was a month long trip. Hiring people who find pleasure in others pain is a terrible business plan for management. I have been working in Customer service for over 20 years and I understand that sometime you have to fake being nice. This manager did not fake being nice and smiled and laughed at the situation. I was shocked and so sad. Telling my mom I couldn't come home for Christmas was the saddest phone call I have had since her mother passed away. I will never fly AA and continue to fly Southwest since they have never given me issues with flying and their flights are reasonably priced compared to AA. I am surprised by how many people have experienced similar issues with AA. How is AA still a company with terrible customer service?
881,"Not Verified |  American should have their flight certificate revoked! I am delayed, and missing a connection, because they cannot calculate the weight distribution properly. For goodness sake, that is the first thing you learn in flight school. Their people treat you like dirt and have no customer focus. If you book on American you deserve the problems you will have to endure. "
882,"✅ Trip Verified |  American cares nothing about doing the right thing in regards to its passengers. Had a flight out of Durango, CO. I checked in and paid my baggage fees online the day before my flight to save time. The morning of my flight there was a snowstorm. Several passengers were late in checking in due to traffic from the storm. American Refused to take our checked luggage saying we had missed the cut off for checking bags. I missed it by 15 min. I had to leave my luggage behind with family members and get on my flight. Other passengers who checked in after me brought their luggage into the plane with them. They were told their bags were too big and would need to be valet checked. So because I listened to the ticket agent and followed what she told me, I had to leave my bag behind and have it shipped to me for $50. I should have ignored her and just proceeded to the plane with my bag and had it valet checked. Also I was at Durango airport not Dallas Fort Worth. They had plenty of time to get our bags on that flight. Now I’ve requested a refund for the $30 checked baggage fee because American refused to take my checked bags. Of course my refund was denied. In the end I’ve learned an expensive lesson. Do not pay baggage fees until you hand American Airlines your bags. I paid for a service through American Airlines that I did not receive. It’s all about the almighty dollar, as usual."
883,"Not Verified |  I had a very traumatic experience trying to come home from Europe with my service dog to make my mother’s funeral. Even though I was assured it was on all my flights it wasn’t. This time I wanted to be sure to avoid such unpleasantness. I went to the airport personally serval times and even purchased my ticket at the counter (very expensive) I even upgraded to first class! Each time I asked about traveling with my service dog I received contradicting information. When I called I would reach someone who barely spoke English with back ground noise that made the call incomprehensible. Finally I found a professional at the end of the phone and she helped me upload all my documents three to be precise in a way that the ”System” would accept them. She assured me all my paperwork was complete and I was confirmed on both of my flight to Cancun and gave me a record locator number. When I checked in at Louisville all went smoothly when I reached Charlotte the agent attending the flight told me no service dog was confirmed on the flight and I would have to find the service desk and deal with the problem. I had also requested wheel chair assistance (which never came). I was forced to stand for over thirty minutes while an extremely unsympathetic supervisor waited on hold to get the authorization I had already spent weeks getting. I was told that they would put me on a latter flight which meant I would arrive in a foreign country as a woman alone and try to speak Spanish, rent a car and find my way to my lodging! I became nervous and was told I could not board the aircraft because I could not obey orders. Finally after I became to upset and confused I left important documents I needed for my service dog to enter Mexico on the counter. After being extremely traumatized I was told I “Could” board the plan. A fully armed police man stood at the gate while Kiki and I were still waiting for clearance in the “computer”. At last I boarded but in my traumatized state I left the documents behind. When I arrived in Mexico I realized they were gone. The Mexican claims department told me they would try to get them put on the next flight and deliver them with my “lost” baggage. I delayed the delivery of my lost bag to await the arrival of my documents. The next day I was told that the supervisor refused to accommodate my request and the documents could only be sent to a USA address. Also when I finally received my bag a valuable item was missing. I think I can get this kind of treatment from one of the other cheaper airlines. Thank you American."
884,Not Verified |  I just flew with the kindest attendant I've ever met. I fly a lot for work and have never met a kinder flight attendant. Her name was Donna from the Austin to Charlotte route. She helped a family from another country that did not speak English. She ensured they were able to get to their next flight and made sure they had snacks and drinks for their next flight since it was short and not providing drink services. She was amazing.
885,"✅ Trip Verified | Don’t fly American Airlines and expect to be on time or treated like a human. The last two times I have flown they have been delayed or canceled and I had to stay in a hotel on my dime. Today, once again delayed and missing our next flight. With the grandkids, a four-year-old and a one year old. Stuck in an airport for over four hours. As always, thank you American for making sure that you guys get richer and we get screwed."
886,Not Verified |  Halfway through the first leg of our flight the crew ran out of champagne (first order) and without any explanation they substituted wine and only admitted problem after I called them back. They then ran out of food and only option offered was dried out inedible chicken. At our 2 hour layover the food and drinks were not restocked on the plane and we reboarded the same plane in the same seat. I cannot believe that in first class food and drinks were allowed to run out and not restocked although there were over 2 hours that they could have done it. This was a long and expensive first class flight that was very disappointing. To add to the lack of food the stewardess were not organized. The service was done in shifts. First row. Then about 5 to 10 minutes then 2nd row. We were in the last row of first and business class (5) total and the people in the first three rows had finished eating by the time we were told that there was no food for us after all. Sorry do you want snacks. For the price we paid to sit in business class I thought that was very disappointing. I had chips for lunch…
887,Not Verified |  We were delayed at security and customs in Dallas and arrived at our gate as soon as we could only to find the gate closed for boarding. The staff at the gate wasn't friendly or helpful. They were aware of our delay but refused to wait. We had to book another flight 12 hours later at Dallas Airport . American Airlines offered no compensation or offer to put us up for the night or even a voucher to get some food. Not impressed with AA and will never fly them again.
888,"✅ Trip Verified |  I paid over $200 for Main cabin plus because I am 6 months pregnant & incredibly uncomfortable. For all four of my flights to and from Boston, I was told they gave my reserved seats away & that I would be reimbursed. After weeks of emails (they have nobody to contact by phone), they told me sorry but seats aren’t guaranteed. The upgrade to Main cabin plus was a complete scam. I was crammed in a middle seat in the back of the plane, while having to get up and bother my neighbors for frequent bathrooms breaks & leg movement. On our flights from Boston to Maui there was no food given or available for purchase (both over 6 hour flights). NO free entertainment or option to purchase wifi. Total Scam."
889,"Not Verified |  Took the available seats next to the restrooms in the back, and was unfortunate to find that I was not provided any overhead storage in this abnormally small row, and had to hold by of my carry on bags under my legs or as they call ""stow "" under the seat in front of me. Come to find out the closest available overhead was already occupied by flight attendants. Attendants are rude and unapproachable. They did not assist me with my stowage issue, and basically served not purpose on this flight."
890,"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight departed and had to return to Buenos Aires because of mechanicals problems. They left us at the airport all night and the counter was supposed to open at 6am , so we were waiting all night and it is 7:30 am and nobody is here to fix the problem. Next flight is at 8 pm so i will be in the airport for more than 24 hours, the company asked us to go to a hotel, i don't have money because my daughter will take care of me as soon as i arrive to USA. American Airlines is doing nothing to fix the problem. This is the last time i use this company."
891,"✅ Trip Verified |  This company should not be in business. I've had the unfortunate experience of having several flights in which part of involved American Airlines. Every single one has ended in disaster, and the customer service is borderline scam. They forced us to check our bags to board the flight stating that the cabin was full. Reality the overhead cabins entire back half was empty. Then they change our boarding gate 10 minutes prior to boarding closing on the opposite side of the terminal. After running we get there 15 minutes before the flight left and they shut the door on us as we are trying to board."
892,"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely the worst airline there is. Delayed my luggage, which had nightly medication needed and tried for literally 2 days to get the damn bag from 2 hours away. Numerous flights in and numerous idiots who not simply just put the bag on the plane to me. Do not use this airline, the lack of customer is very poor."
893,"Not Verified | I have been flying American Airlines for more than 25 years. On my recent trip from Charlotte to Portland, there was no food offered for a 5.5 hour flight. There was no in-flight entertainment devices offered. I was required to use my own cell phone. One hour into the flight, the beverage cart came around. It did not come around again until almost an hour before landing. Beverage selection was very limited, if any, I become more and more disappointed with American Airlines. Although I have been a loyal customer, I will be choosing alternative airlines in the future. I am done with the lack of customer service at American Airlines."
894,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline ever! Worst customer service ever. Kept us sitting in airport on a return flight from Memphis for 6 hours promising that another flight was coming, then cancelled us. Then, after servicing most of the passengers, they simply told us they ran out of vouchers, and we were on our own. They admitted responsibility but said, in effect, too bad. After going it on our own, they first fought the reimbursement, but then reimbursed some of my group. Still, after nearly 2 months of waiting, I have not received my reimbursement for food, hotel, and taxi. Simply the worst customer relations I have ever seen in my life. Please don't fly American Airlines!"
895,"Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. Our flight got delayed, missed the connection. Had to sleep at the airport because the hotel we were set up for was infested with bedbugs. The flight itself was OK for the money. But the delays and the service are very poor. We got rerouted the next day making a 1 stop flight to a 2 stop flight. Best part now we are trying to fly back, the same thing."
896,"Not Verified |  Our flight out of San Jose, CR was delayed by 3 hours and hence we missed our connection. Hence ended up with over night stay at Dallas. The part which made the experience terrible was the customer service and flight attendant. Seemed like they were pretty unhappy and irritated. The flight attendant was not patient to listen to our questions and very rude in our flight from sjo to dfw. This was when we should have been irritated with our flight delay. On our onward flight from PDX to Miami as well, we could hear flight attendant really complaining about AA and some policies they have implemented for their staff. It is one thing to be unhappy, but another thing to complain loudly in the flight in front of customers. There is probably a culture issue within the company that needs to be addressed. If possible I will avoid flying through AA."
897,"Not Verified |  First of all we are newlyweds we had assigned seats, and seating assignments were changed, had to ask different customers so we can sit together .. ridiculous.. Couldn't imagine why they changed our seats and coming on a full flight they changed our seating again didn't get this program. I'm 6'2 had a aisle seat, they placed me in the middle seat, between married couple. Terrible, as well as my wife in a middle 2 rows ahead. Crazy business had to ask customers again to sit next my wife. Thanks for the unprofessionalism American"
898,✅ Trip Verified |  They make you check your carry on items if boarding last only to get on the aircraft to see 5-10 empty bins. Every time I fly with them there is always some sort of delay which when connecting flights can cause a missed flight or with paid parking can cause extra charges. For what they charge all these things should be avoided. This is not a one time thing. It is literally every time I use them. Honestly I have better luck with cheaper airlines like frontier and spirit in terms of being on time and bag availability.
899,Not Verified |  Layovers won't accommodate just a little time to get to the next flight when they are the ones causing the delay. (only 4 minutes- layover is now 5 hours instead of 30 minutes) Staff is rude and clearly deals with this all the time and just doesn't care. They are dismissive and unprofessional. I honestly don't know how this airline stays in business. Unfortunately the flights home are this horrific airline. I'd rather drive at this point. Would get there earlier. 
900,"✅ Trip Verified |  Purchased emergency ticket for friend. The flight was cancelled. I requested a refund. They told me that it would take 7-10 business days for the refund to be processed. Let's make this very clear. I paid for a service that was not given to me. That money is needed so that I can get this person another flight on a different airline and they are telling me that it takes 7 to 10 business days to refund money for a service they did not provide. This is absolutely insane. When you cancel a flight and a customer requests a refund it needs to be issued immediately, not in 7 to 10 business days."
901,"Not Verified |  American Airlines must change its catering. On every recent flight, in first or business, food was inedible, wine was not drinkable, and overall service was lacking. Flight attendants take the heat, it's not their fault, the airline food and beverage program is mismanaged and grossly unacceptable. International flights should be a step up, not down as AA is."
902,"✅ Trip Verified |  
I was on flight 1505 from DFW to Indianapolis on 15 Nov and I had a fainting spell. I'm so grateful to the Flight Attendants, the Nurses that were on the Plane and the Passengers that assisted. I didn't get the names of everyone, but Shantel (I hope this is right) was the Nurse that stayed with me along with Christine (a Passenger) until my daughter got there to place me in the car. The Flight Attendants were so wonderful, they didn't make me feel like was a bother to them. They kept reassuring and checking on me until we landed. I know that it's part of their job to look after the Passengers but not everyone take this part of Customer Service this seriously. I can't put into words just how grateful I am, it was very scary and I was Traveling along. God Bless each and everyone that took care of me as well as the other Passengers, I was told by some others that they were Praying for me as I left."
903,"Not Verified | When I arrived at bag checking I was told the carry on bag that I have taken on numerous airlines for a number of years was too large for a carry on and that I would have to pay 90 Euros and check the bag. This would have been okay except once on the flight I noticed many bags as large or larger than the one I had to pay for. If I had to pay for a item that did not fit into the measuring cart, everyone should have to pay. It is unfair to make some pay and let other go right ahead with their items that won't fit into the guidelines. I have contacted AA several times and they refuse to refund my money. This is very poor customer service and I will not fly American again if it is within my power to avoid them. I will continue to tell others about this unfair decision on their part."
904,"Not Verified | American Airlines is the absolute worst! In the last three trips I've taken, twice I was unable to get a wheelchair and had to walk, and put myself out horribly, in order to get to my gate, and now I'm sitting waiting for a flight with two other people I was supposed to be traveling with, and after spending over an hour on the phone 2 weeks ago, I found out our seats were never properly assigned and nothing that was requested was ever done. They have the absolute most horrible customer service of any airline I have had to deal with. Then, they tell me it's my fault because I didn't double check to make sure I had seats even though I was told that I did. They can't even be nice about it. Amazing how people could not do their jobs, be rude to people, and do everything wrong, and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about it. They don't have a problem, they don't lose their jobs, they're not uncomfortable, they're not the ones that can't walk for 2 days after traveling, they couldn't care less. Save yourself! Do not use this airline"
905,"✅ Trip Verified |  Never again. Every flight was delayed due to them not being able to board on time or workers being late. I was supposed to get home at 11.30am, had to rebook twice, hoping to be home by midnight now. Rude, careless, staff. Fly Delta."
906,"Not Verified |  So first the flight gets changed from a 2:30pm arrival to now 10:45 pm if lucky. Now pushing a 3 hr layover in DFW instead of 1 hr. The plane was at the gate and not boarding because get this ""They can't find the mechanic that boarded the plane"". Awesome customer service BTW. If you love being treated with the ""we don't care attitude"", then by all means buy an overpriced ticket from these chumps and enjoy your dreaded trip."
907,"Not Verified |  Avoid this airline at all costs!! Their customer service is terrible down the line, and their policies on their refunds are atrocious. My fiancé and I were forced to pay for a hotel room in Dallas after issues with two separate flights. Typically, American Airlines would provide vouchers; however, we were told they ran out of hotel vouchers prior to us being able to receive a room. We were then forced to pay out of pocket, and are now fighting to get our money back that we had to pay for this hotel. not only did we had to pay for the hotel, but there was a hidden fee of $170 added to my account for some hotel booking service that I was unaware of. American Airlines states they will pay for a reasonably priced hotel, but do not state anywhere online what a reasonable price is for them. American Airlines is attempting to pay us just $100, with some additional trip credits added in. I failed to see how trip credits are a viable source of a refund here, as I never want to fly with American Airlines again due to this experience. Their customer service team tries to push you off to the next person/airport, and nobody is willing to accommodate your needs. American Airlines fails to open up to their mistakes, which is why I will not be flying with them again. Avoid this airline at all cost."
908,"Not Verified |  My flight to Bogota was fine. Uneventful. My return date was November 1st. I had an early flight from Cartegena to Bogota. This was with another airline. I had about an hour after arrival in Bogota to go from national to international area. Due to this being an international flight I could not get an e-ticket or do any pre-boarding. I arrived at the AA counter and was the only person in line. There was one agent. He ignored me and walked away. Unfortunately I do not speak Spanish. While standing at the AA counter I received notification my flight was boarding. I went to Immigration to ask for assistance. I was walked from one end of the airport to the other. Finally, I was told where there would be AA agents to assist me. An agent by the name of Verantina spoke with my son and daughter-in-law. I could see the agent getting frustrated and actually throwing her pen down but did not know what was being said. She handed me my phone back with a forced smile. I asked my son what was going on and he said she will not help you. He was told it isn't American Airlines' fault that I missed my flight. I am not trying to blame AA for my missed flight, I needed assistance in getting home! I never in my life experienced an airline whose agents did not try at all to assist their customers. Verantina was fine with leaving me stranded in a foreign country. No options. I sat down and cried. My son finally found another airline that could get me back home and purchased my ticket. I will do my best to never fly on American Airlines if I avoid it."
909,"Not Verified |  The in-flight entertainment system was broken for the 9 hour flight. Was broken in business class too. I purchased the WiFi access to use my mobile device to stay busy. But the food was great, cabin crew was terrific, and you made up for it by pro-actively re-booking my connection in ORD to a flight that I could actually make. Well done."
910,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible. First they delay the flight for multiple hours, then they change the gate without notifying my wife or I, then they try to claim that they called our names over the loud-speaker which they absolutely did not. We barely made the flight. Never flying with them again and I suggest you do the same."
911,"✅ Trip Verified | This is the absolute worst airline I have ever corresponded with. The staff on call is rude and impatient. I had booked a flight with a friend which got cancelled due to Covid. They gave us credits at the time. Later on when we tried to book our flights, she got her credits and I didn't. I told them this is ridiculous how can you treat two people in the exact same position differently and all I got was long holds on call and the most generic and annoying email replies of my life. NEVER FLY AA!!"
912,"✅ Trip Verified |  Most of my grievances are specifically with the Charlotte/Douglas Airport American Airlines employees. The outward bound trip had almost a 3 hour delay getting on our connection flight from there to Nashville ... this was after the first long leg flight from Germany to Charlotte, so we already had a 3 hour layover as we had to customs in NC and collect our bag and bring it for drop off to our connection flight to Nashville. After doing all that we end up being delayed almost 3 hours (so 6 hours total at this Airport). We could have rented a car and driven to Nashville in that timeframe which we would have preferred honestly because then maybe our toddler would have gotten some sleep. Once we finally made it to Nashville the baggage crew had us waiting almost an hour for our bags. Now coming back to Germany trip is where it gets worse. Nashville flight to Charlotte everything was fine with exception the plane we had this time had like micro storage above that no one could fit their carry on bags which caused a lot of bag drop off and pick up at flight gate and of course our travel stroller is the last item that comes out getting off that flight in Charlotte NC to transfer to our connection to Frankfurt Germany. At that gate (D9 specifically) in Charlotte NC is where I was having to deal with the very rude woman at the gate and that's where I'm positive I also ended up leaving behind my brand new jacket while I was being rudely talked down to and ultimately had to just walk away to avoid further confrontation with this American Airlines employee. This all started with boarding the gate when the woman employee requested I fold down my stroller, so she could check its size in the metal carry on baggage thing they have near gate. Ok no problem I'm confident we will not have an issue as it's the same plane we took coming here and I know the travel stroller fits in the overhead with no issues (Joolz Aer -specifically super lightweight and compact for airplane travel). My husband and child continue boarding as we have a carseat to install and need the time to do this, so I'm standing there with my stroller on the measuring thing and it fits perfectly when she started telling me no it's too big and comes right on the max line for size and demanding I bag and tag it. I question her on this and said it was no issue coming here and fit fine to which I'm told, ""I don't care what they let you do on that flight you're not allowed to bring that stroller as a carry on because I say it wont fit and I just told some first class couple the same too about their stroller, so if they can't bring it neither are you!"". OK wow, so I tell her my husband has the travel bag in the carry on suitcase and I need to leave and get on the plane to get it from him and I'll be right back then to which I'm getting all this attitude from her and she began saying things like well that's not my problem I didn't tell him could go ahead and board. I quickly board and get the travel bag from my husband and run back out to the gate entrance to bag and tag the stroller. While doing this I sit down my jacket close by and then become rushed by an different attendant about tagging the bag. I ask her to give me a minute bag it and she sticks on the tag and hands me my receipt and tells me to bring it the gate drop off where I saw someone else leave their stroller near plane entrance. I pick it up and turn to grab by jacket when I'm suddenly screamed at."
913,✅ Trip Verified |  American Airlines as usual delayed the flight by more than 1 hour and it is my first connecting flight and it got delayed by more than 1 hour. All other airlines should simply break ties with AA and don't choose AA as connecting flight. Worst airline of the century when it comes to on time performance. Go AA only if you don't care for time & have no dependency on arrival time.
914,✅ Trip Verified |  Fly anything but American Airlines. Was on my honeymoon this weekend and our original no layover flights were changed by American Airlines to connecting flights with a layover. They were kind enough to give us 1 hour to get through customs and make it to the connecting flight. After running across the airport we still couldn’t make the connecting flight. When I say I would never ever fly with them again I mean it. I wouldn’t let my family fly with American Airlines either. They turned what was supposed to be relaxing into a fruitless mad dash across an airport. They nickel and dime you for entertainment while forcing the staff to push memberships on the passengers. The seat size on their 777s (the flight we arrived to Jamaica in) had horrible seat sizes. The return flights which were bungled were better than the 777 flight but not by much.
915,✅ Trip Verified |  First they seated my newly wedded wife and I two rows apart and refused to move us together and then they completely messed up our brand new $200 Disney 50th anniversary rolling suitcase  that we bought last night before flying home today and there is no way to contact them about it. I can’t put pics on their facebook page and their “contact” link on their site sends me straight back to their home page. We will never fly with them again.
916,"✅ Trip Verified | Gate changes all day. Received all notices until the LAST one. Had to run from A13 to D21 in 10 minutes. Made it just after boarding closed. Agent was able to call the aircraft and got me on my flight home. So, I'm an upset, stressed out, sweaty, shaky, out of breath, senior citizen boarding the plane. Flight attendant told me to calm down and breathe. Extremely disappointed in the way this flight was handled ALL DAY! It's downright ridiculous! Please take into consideration what you are doing to your passengers when these changes are made. Thank you."
917,"Not Verified |  They pressured us to board the plane in Dallas with minimal layover, but then made us sit in the plane on the runway for almost an hour. Our baggage did not make the flight to Houston, there has been zero communication about the bags. I stood in line for about 30 minutes late at night with 3 kids crying out of hunger, before I abandoned making a claim. The line was 30 people deep and had not moved one spot in 30 minutes, the math on that wait was not in my favor. When I went to the airport at about 6:30 in the morning, the representative at the American Airline customer service was dismissive of the fact that I had not received my luggage, and said that they could not open the office until 8:30 AM. There are over 20 American Airline employees standing around and chatting, drinking coffee, and no one can be bothered to help walk downstairs and try to open the door to give me my luggage (apparently that is a whole separate department and they cannot be bothered with retrieving luggage). Apparently, humans are so compartmentalized that opening a door that is a few hundred feet away, requires another department and possibly a whole new committee meeting."
918,"Not Verified |  I'm pleased with the flights and the staff. I understand that delays might happen on occasion, and difficulties. One such example is a mechanical issue on engine start, which happened on my return, at Tampa. The message from the pilot was clear. The problem was fixed luckily after a short period of time. The captain kept us informed. This is flight AA 1466 on 11/8/22. There is nothing that could have been done better by staff, for the 4 flights on this round trip. Thank you, captain and staff."
919,✅ Trip Verified |  The worst experience flying ever. Got in from Austin with 2.5 hours to spare. Told Gate was B10. Confirmed on board. Sat there for over an hour only to find out gate was changed to B8. Never heard 1 announcement until gate was closing. Had to go to customer service who put me on a flight that left in 5 hours. Asked what gate. I was told (as was another woman who missed the same flight) A2. After sitting there for awhile was told our gate was B6. Sitting here now. Hopefully I get him sometime this week. 
920,"✅ Trip Verified | I had an amazing 2 week vacation in the UK and returned to America on Friday November 4. I had received a confirmation email for my return flight from London Heathrow to Charlotte, NC on November 3rd for the 4th at 1.30pm. Early morning on the 4th, I received a text message from American Airlines of a reminder that my flight departs at 10.15 am with a different flight number and changed terminal. I did not have phone service nor was there time to call anyone. I was 2 hours away from the airport staying at a friend's house. I tried to get an earlier train to the airport, but it didn't run earlier. I went to Travelocity where I booked my flight and it still showed 1.30 pm departure. I went to the American Airlines site and it showed my flight as 10.30 am. I clicked on change flight and was able to change it back to 1.30 pm. However, I was also charged $2250.00 for this plane ticket. I talked with an agent when I returned for my refund and was told my plane ticket was non changeable and non refundable. She said it was use it or lose it. But apparently, it was ok for American Airlines to change my flight. I received a survey from American Airlines which I gave zeros on every level. I also wrote why and what my experience was. I also stated that I still want my refund and I would give them a few days to get back to me. They did not. So, I am going to share my experience with as many people as possible."
921,"Not Verified |  I was flying from Calgary to Milwaukee on November 1st. After waiting at the airport for 10 hours because our 6.44am flight kept getting delayed, it was finally cancelled. After rescheduling to the next day, they would not let us get our bags, for another 2 hours. During the whole day, there was no communication provided to any of us passengers. We were all missing connections, and no one was helping us. A few of us even tried to get on other flights, but they would not removed our bags from the ""broken airplane"" and put them on the other flights, further leaving us stuck at the airport. The next day, the flight was once again, delayed for over 5 hours. Again, no communication to us about the delays except for the messages we were getting on the app. Not only did I miss work, I was not given a food voucher or hotel voucher. I contacted American Airlines, where they gave me a $50 flight voucher. I told them that was not an acceptable resolution, for being stuck at the airport for over 15 hours in two days. According to my passenger rights, I am entitled to compensation, but they will not provide that and have stopped responding to my emails. I do not recommend flying with them, especially after the poor lack of service trying to remediate the situation."
922,"Not Verified |  Weather conditions delay. No solutions provided. I had to do it all myself to fix their delayed flight issue. My flight was delayed 7 hours, for a total of 14 hour layover. The expected layover was 3 hours. No solutions were provided by the American Airline staff in Phoenix. I had to push for a new flight on phone, and just after getting confirmation, I was told by American Airlines Customer Service Desk it’s too late to board. So why was I sold a flight that was too late to board? The staff in person tend to be very insensitive and uninterested in genuine help towards others. Additionally, no one in Phoenix AA was able to help me schedule a flight to reach my destination. They put me on standby lists and said “we really don’t know, there’s nothing available until tomorrow night”…for a total of 24+ hours of travel time. I asked “what do you think is best”…no advice given. Just clueless faces. My Expected travel time before delay was 13 hours. I had to purchase a whole new flight from Delta for 1k,so if you know there’s a weather condition during your travel at any point, book another airline…they won’t help solve the issue. They will expect you to fix it."
923,"Not Verified |  This airline strives for your loyalty. The propaganda they present about all the perks and rewards are superficial. Please do not be drawn into their words and advertisements. The fact that they strive for your loyalty but show zero loyalty back to you when needed is prevalent at the most in opportune time. I was a big advocate for this airlines being that I fly between 3-5 times a month. The perks for being a loyalty member were ok at best. The more you ride the train the more you see that loyalty is just a number. When you ask of them in a time of need, they will not be there. All you are is a number when it comes to their customer service. I booked a flight 5 months in advance. Their policy is within 24 hrs of booking you can cancel for a refund. I cancelled within 48 hrs and all they would be willing to do is give me a flight credit of the amount spent ($2500). They do not budge and the lack of loyalty in return is magnified. Spare yourself the stress and find a more customer orientated airlines to be loyal too. Let me add that you cannot talk to someone physically over the phone in their customer relations department. You’re Left with submitting a form and waiting for their response which is 7 business days."
924,"✅ Trip Verified |  My experience has resulted in a boycott of this airline. I am a heart surgeon, who was boarding with my carry-on, roll aboard, overhead luggage containing my heart surgery operating room equipment (including several magnification loops) when I was told by the AA gate attendants I could not board unless I checked my roll aboard through regular baggage to my destination. I told them that was unacceptable, asked them if there was any other option, told there was none, and I sat down and missed my flight as they still called my name through the overhead loud speakers while the gate agents looked helpless. I will never fly American Airlines again, and do not recommend."
925,"Not Verified |  Booked a holiday with British airways and my flights were with American airlines. This is the first time I have flown with American Airlines.  Rude, unprofessional is an understatement. The first two cabins got a bar and the last cabin got squash prepoured on a tray? Supposed to be complimentary drinks but they couldn't be bothered to get the trolley out on a 3 hour flight. The food was inedible, just awful and we all went hungry. I was traveling as a family of 6. When I ordered 6 cokes on a different flight the stewardess was very rude shaking her head at me and pulling faces. I told her we were entitled from a drink from the bar each. She replied ""for god's sake"" and walked off as if I was being greedy asking for my children's drinks. Unbelievably bad service and treatment. I had the misfortune of flying with American airlines on four separate flights in 2 weeks I complained whilst waiting for my connecting flight and they didn't care and said hope to see you soon. No way will you ever see us again"
926,"✅ Trip Verified |  We have to fly from ABQ to MI for several important medical treatments in Dec 2022. In Oct. the airline cancelled our afternoon return flight from MQT and offered 2 choices: take the only other flight and miss our 2 treatments on the last morning there or incur the costs of food, extra day rental car and motel stay to fly out the next day. We are barely staying up with medical bills and home repairs (leaking roof, broken water heater) and the extra $250-$275 to stay the extra day means something will not get paid. They don’t give a hoot about how it impacts the people who keep them in business. Shame on American Airlines. This is the last time we will ever give them our money! I rated the other aspects based on my previous flights with this airline."
927,"✅ Trip Verified |  The rude woman at the front desk got mad at me because I asked to check in some of my luggage early and I did not know that was against the rules. Because I insisted, she got mad and canceled my flight without telling me. So when I go to check in with all of my family, I get the run around, I get ignored, and they had me all through the airport trying to get to this flight that I was never going to get on. Then they tell me that I missedthe flight because I arrived late. I learn later that I was not late, because my flight actually got delayed and I was actually early. But they did not tell me that because I was no longer on that flight(since she had cancelled me off that flight). So they make me think it's my fault that I missed my flight and in reality I miss the fight because she changed my flight. I sat and cried out of anger and humiliation and they did not care. That was their way of reprimanding me and I was never informed of what really happened. Inhumane treatment of fellow human beings."
928,"✅ Trip Verified | I paid extra to get into priority 4 so I wouldn't have to check my carry on bag. I was still forced to, being told there would not be room on the plane. I got to the plane, guess what, plenty of room for my bag I no longer have possession of. If I wanted to check my bag, I would! I have laptops and personal belongings in this bag, I do not want it being thrown around. Not to mention, the stupid app won't let you check in. You have to be at the airport to check in. Stupid. I fly with Southwest, Delta, and others, this is the absolute worst service ever."
929,"Not Verified |  
This airline has rebooked my flight while I was in route to my first flight or while I was sitting on my flight 2 times now. Both times, I have a strong reason to believe that they did this for their own convenience (unwilling to pay me back for my ticket due to plane troubles, and instead blaming it on the weather, or cancelling my flight because due to a ""delay"" I was not likely to make a connecting flight) Either way, the airline was not only inconsiderate of me and my schedule and had me booked for lay overs over 8 hours long but also had a major attitude about it. I understand that its not the employees fault that the company they work for is so unorganized and pays them so little, especially as they are likely to be cursed out numerous times a day, due to the low quality of this airline, but I do expect better given the amount I have to pay for a ticket."
930,"✅ Trip Verified | Is it typical practice to notify of delays via text/email, but not gate changes or early arrivals of planes via text or email? Husband is stuck in a DC airport after a full day of weather delays today with American. Oddly, my MIL and niece flew from SLC with no delays. Clear weather radars."
931,Not Verified |  Ruined my trip with delays. Then 3 weeks ago I canceled a flight a month in advance and was told that I wasn't getting a refund or anything back. When I tried I was hung up on 3 times. I've never been disrespected this badly by any company. Worst customer service ever
932,"Not Verified |  If I could rate them lower than a one star, I would. To make a long story short, I was attempting to bring a pelican case full of expensive camera equipment onto the plane as a carry on. It was small enough and easily contained $10K worth of equipment inside. While at Ronald Reagan, I was told that I must check the bag or not get let on. I reluctantly handed over the pelican and was assured that the luggage was in good hands. I found out once arriving in Phoenix that baggage workers stole nearly $8K worth of equipment and are also are refusing to cover the loss. If you fly with them, do not check anything of value. There isn’t a guarantee that it will be there when you land. And yes, there were no lithium batteries in the case; just in case if American Airlines is reading this."
933,"✅ Trip Verified | I am writing this review because the experience that I have had with American Airlines in the past two days is honestly unbelievable. My daughter is a minor and was flying back from Anchorage to Myrtle Beach on November 2, 2022. When she arrived at the airport for check in they sent her to the gate with the app on her cell phone for boarding. She is an unaccompanied minor which I paid extra for so you cannot use the app for boarding. That was their first mistake because by the time she went back to the desk she ended up missing her flight. Because of that she did not return to Myrtle Beach when she was supposed to. She had to be put on a flight for the next night which was extremely inconvenient especially because of her school. She then leaves Anchorage on the next flight which was the next night and when she arrives in Dallas she has no unaccompanied minor tag or chaperone. When I find this out I go straight to the Myrtle Beach airport to find out why my child is alone in Dallas. In the process she finds someone and ask about her chaperone and she is told that she is not on a list for a chaperone. A lady sits with her anyway but tells her that she will probably not have a chaperone when she gets to Charlotte. While I am at Myrtle Beach airport I find out that Anchorage airport put my child on the plane and did not list her as an unaccompanied minor so she was not chaperoned. I wasted my entire morning at Myrtle Beach airport trying to make sure that my child was safe and would make it back to Myrtle Beach because she still had another connecting flight. I am making this review to make anyone aware that has a minor child to possibly find another airline because this is the most unacceptable thing that I have ever had to deal with. I am extremely unhappy with this entire situation and I can say that if nothing else the one mistake that an airline should never make is not having a chaperone available for a minor that has three different flights. When booking this flight I was assured multiple times that my child would not be alone and that was not the case. Once again this whole situation has been absolutely unbelievable. I pray that no parent ever has to experience the stress that I have with this airline."
934,"✅ Trip Verified |  After 55 years of flying, as my father before me, to every major city in the US and to many countries abroad with over 100 flights annually, I can truely say I have had it with civil aviation. I never want to see another domestic carrier again. DFW/XNA this past Friday was one of the worst on record for me. A 42 minute flight was most deplorable. I have been tied to United, Delta, SW and even TWA, US AIR, Continental over the years until nearly all were absorbed by the Big 3. Now with AA exclusive since 1995. The perpetuated lies from pilots and maintenance personnel is just beyond the pale. It borders on harassment and being taken hostage. Yes the weather at DFW was sketchy on 10/28 but most every flight was moving in and out. I am OK with being delayed 2-3 hours if I am told the truth and updated, but 7 hours is horrid for passengers and AA staff. The lead FA and gate agent were on the verge of panic attacks because of the lies being told. The Captain just gets up and walks out without saying a word for he timed out on his duty hours. The FAs were furious he did this and they were calling their management over it. Secondly, How can a passenger expect they are being told the truth when you are told your aircraft "" has been taken out of service"" by maintenance only to reboard the same aircraft an hour later. I have my suspicions about that sequence of events but to long to go on in this forum. In the end the FAs saved us for they extended their duty hours to get us to XNA, otherwise we were screwed. Every passenger should be grateful to them as I was, even being 7 hours late. I read these comments about AA, it is shameful that a once premier domestic carrier and brand is now rated as a 2 star carrier. Its shameful that AA management does not care one ounce for their staff nor the passengers but only for the stock price of the shareholder. I don't begrudge that but I want reliable service week in and week out when I travel on business and not the ongoing maintenance and operational stupidity that happens almost weekly. The new loyalty program is joke and only rewards those committed to a CC not the AA brand. So when booking AA, roll the dice and take your chances. I would hate to stake my vacation, honeymoon or cruise based on their service level. I doubt you are much better off with SW, Jet Blue, Alaska or United. Maybe Delta is the best bet in todays environment but with their 15,000 pilots threatening strike action I doubt they can be depended on either. Good Luck out there because civil aviation is no longer civil."
935,"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I were flying Barcelona to Kansas City via Philadelphia. (Flight 743, Scheduled for Oct 14) Our flight had mechanical issues and was delayed to the next day. (Oct 15) AA-BCN provided an excellent hotel for passengers and did an excellent service start to finish. Cudos for AA-BCN staff. We were to a finally arrived to MCI 2 days later after another provided hotel from AA in Philadelphia. While working with the AA-BCN staff, they informed the passengers that this cancellation / delay would fall EC 261 passenger rights, and definitely submit the documents. I have found the EC 261 form itself, but info has was evident on where to send the doc for processing. I have been working with AA support trying to get an answer. It 'appears' that the AA support is most likely robo-responders. Response letters that do not say anything. I have not found any address or instructions on where to send the document (and any others) to get this into the AA system. Any ideas? The 2nd issue is about the complaint / concern with the far less than acceptable overnight accommodation in Philadelphia. The hotel in question is the Wyndham Garden Hotel. This is how AA takes care of international flyers? I have to believe than no customer support executives have stayed at this hotel. How does AA justify sending their flying customers to a 1 star hotel. Unbelievable, but that is AA's hotel of choice. Does anyone work in AA customer support? "
936,"✅ Trip Verified |  Return flight to LAX. Flight out AA 265 wonderful, multiple choice meal, drinks, IFE functioning. Return AA 266 provided the worst culinary slop ever seen. IFE not working entire 5 1/2 hr flight. Flight attendants fantastic, mostly being apologetic for food service and lack of IFE. Business class, had only one fixed menu consisting of: no appetizer, an entree of beans and quinoa - navy beans, kidney beans, fava beans. For the medical audience, fava beans can induce a hemolytic blood crisis in patients with an enzyme deficiency. To not offer any choice definitely put passengers at risk. Grapes and processed cheese. Processed cheese! Luscious dessert - Oreos in a foil packet. There was at least a choice of two different crackers! I've attached a photo of the delectable repast. The flight attendants all advised writing letters to AA at aa.com, as this was not the first time the Lihue-LAX flight was shortchanged in quality. The letter was subsequently sent on the aa.com complaint window. As a frequent flyer, we normally would expect some amends in terms of a mileage bonus or something considering the fare paid, the lack of any IFE on a long haul flight, and the abysmal meal served. This was their response, suspect automated: October 19, 2022 Hello xxxxx: Thank you for contacting American Airlines. We strive to put our customers at the center of everything we do. The details you provided highlight the importance of that focus, and we are sorry to hear things did not go as planned. Please know that we strive to learn from every experience, so we appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us. Your input will be shared with our team as we continue towards our goal of providing a world class experience. Thank you again for reaching out to share your experience with us. We hope to better deliver on our high standard of excellence next time we have the opportunity to welcome you aboard. Sincerely, xxxxx Customer Relations American Airlines AA. Your opinion matters to us! We invite you to share your overall experience in this quick one minute survey. Click here for the survey. We appreciate your time and valuable feedback. The biggest laugh came from the one minute survey, where first question was "" How likely are you to refer friends and family to American Airlines ?"". AA didn't lose a customer, though I would never fly that route again on AA. They have lost a lot of my respect, and lost any referrals that I might have given. Loyalty means nothing to AA - a common sentiment, no doubt."
937,"✅ Trip Verified |  Montreal to Indianapolis via Charlotte. I was not able to get on board for my connection at CLT, when they gave me my boarding pass I didn't had a seat so I goes to the onboarding agent counter to ask her some questions and she told me the flight was overbooked by 17 people .... how it can possible? They wanted to give me a money compensation but I didn't care about money compensation because it was a business flight so the company who I work for was paying, I missed the diner kickoff of an intern technician competition it's priceless. So I was stuck in CLT, the sweet onboarding agent found me a flight on the next morning but the new American Airlines supervisor didn't want to give me an hotel compensation for the night because I was supposedly not there when they call me for boarding ... but I was there 30 min before boarding. The boarding agent was arguing with him to make him understood but he didn't want to understand, unacceptable! October 21th 2022, IND to MTL, I had a connection to PHL. During the night I received an email, the flight was cancelled and they give me another flight 5 hours late in the day. New connection CLT, okay fine I go to the airport, the new flight is delayed about 30min then 45, 60, 75, 120 min. Enough delayed to miss my connection to CLT. Unacceptable! The boarding agent found me a flight next morning, They give me a night at the hotel and then I took my flight on the next morning. Everybody told me to avoid American Airlines and now I understand why. Trust me I will never travel with them once it's over."
938,"✅ Trip Verified | Could it be? Does AA have their mojo back? At least in premium cabins it seems they do. I have flown 3 flights in two weeks and all were excellent. Hawaii to/from west coast generally gets the worst of everything. Tonight’s flight far exceeded my expectations. Hot meal, coursed out followed by ice cream sundaes! The flight attendant worked hard, almost solo to serve, clean up, etc.. all with a genuine smile. The seats were comfy. My negatives are no screens and no Wi-Fi. No excuse for no Wi-Fi…other airlines have it. Flight was on time and we were left impressed..even luggage delivery was swift which is unheard of in Honolulu."
939,"✅ Trip Verified | We boarded the flight and when everyone was seated, they said get your bags and get down there is a change in flight. We got down and they don't even know what our new gate will be. They eventually got us a new gate number. We got to the new gate and they promised that the flight was here and they are just cleaning it and will be boarding in 5 minutes. Then after about 30 minutes they announce that the flight needed repairs. And after that no more updates for about an hour and we are sitting here with no idea of what is happening. Customer support is getting rude and people are just frustrated. I have heard a lot of bad things about American Airlines but I didn't know it was this bad. This is my second time of flying with them and I know this will be my last. If you have other options don't choose American airlines, they are a total failure to humanity."
940,"Not Verified |  I am from the United States but teach in Thailand. Last Christmas, I was back in the United States visiting family and friends. This was when COVID was absolutely rampant in the U.S. and ended up getting COVID while there and was very, very sick from it. At that time, to get into Thailand, you needed a negative PCR COVID test, which I didn’t have, for my original flight to get back to Thailand. I ended up having to change my flight twice because of all of this and missed more than a week of school because of it. It was extremely stressful, especially while being so, so sick from COVID like I was. The customer service I received when I needed to rebook my flight multiple times was phenomenal. That was all such a stressful situation, and dealing with American to rebook my flight could’ve been one more area of stress, but it wasn’t. And I was so, so thankful. I called later than I was supposed to one of the times because I was driving to the airport to see if maybe I would get my COVID test back in time while driving to the airport to make my flight. I didn’t get the test back in time but didn’t call right away to change my flight because I had a pounding headache that was turning into a migraine and was extremely exhausted. When I called a few hours later, the woman I spoke to was incredibly helpful and understanding and still allowed me to rebook my flight without having to pay for a new one. She didn’t give me a hard time or make me wait a long time. It’s almost a year later, and I still remember her kindness and am still so thankful for her and how she helped me in the midst of a really stressful, really hard situation. I felt like she really valued customers as people and understood how stressful air travel was at that time; she wasn’t just going by policies. She may have technically been “breaking the policy,” but she made me want to be a loyal customer to American. With all of my flights since, when American has been an option, I’ve chosen American almost every time. She made me feel valued and seen as a person. So if anyone from American reads these reviews, I want you to know showing understanding and care to your customers, like this woman did to me, is how you gain loyal customers. Work to keep your employees like her, and hire more like her!"
941,✅ Trip Verified |  First class service has been back for a while at AA and I enjoy it (specifically the pre-meal warm nuts). I find the tickets a bit pricey and the first class seat only average for the 5 hours spent in it compared to other transcon services serving California. But the staff is pleasant and service enjoyable. Food options can be inconsistent but booking special meals is easy online and are great alternatives to main courses. I switched to AA after flying more than 2.3M miles with Delta and do not regret that choice!
942,"✅ Trip Verified | As a twelve year military veteran, I’ve spent a significant amount of time on flights all over the world. In that time, I’ve never felt the need to write a bad review until American Airlines. Prior to the start of the trip, we had to rebook multiple times and reschedule plans due to the airlines canceling flights and expecting us to deal with their total lack of organization via email and numerous phone calls. During our first flight home, they canceled our connecting flight three separate times. They ultimately rescheduled us for a flight that departs 25 hours later. Bear in mind, we had originally paid extra to get an early flight home and now we’re an entire day late. We spent 30 minutes attempting to locate any American Airline employees to help in the airport. We finally located the “Admirals Club” (a club to supposedly help American Airlines guests) and asked for assistance switching the destination to a closer airport so we could rent a car with our own money and the guy refused to help us because we weren’t card members. Not only did he refuse to help us, but he proceeded to mock our circumstances and went as far as having the audacity to ask if we wanted to sign up for an American Airlines credit card because he would then, and only then, be able to assist us. If you want to pay thousands of dollars to be treated as if you don’t matter, American Airlines is the place for you. I’m going to happily spend the next 25 hours on every travel review website explaining just how our experience was, to hopefully advise other travelers to book elsewhere and help them avoid enduring this horrific experience. "
943,"✅ Trip Verified | We were supposed to fly from San Diego to Dallas on Friday afternoon for the weekend. They cancelled our flight when we were on our way to the airport...due to expected weather in Dallas. Our friends took Southwest Airlines and made it to Dallas. Their flight was delayed, but was not cancelled. So now we're not getting in to Dallas until Saturday 1.00, and returning Sunday evening. I can understand if all flights are cancelled due to weather. But other airlines are still flying. American must not have great pilots. Never ever will I choose American over Southwest again."
944,"Not Verified |  Complete joke of an airline. I was supposed to take a flight to Dallas and then get a connection to Baltimore. My first flight was delayed for maintenance and cause me to miss my connection. They gave me a new flight, this time adding another connection in Chicago. The flight to Chicago gets delayed an hour because we're waiting on the crew. I get to Chicago and my flight is once again delayed for maintenance. By the time I get to my original destination, it's been an extra 6 hours"
945,Not Verified | Will not fly again. Plane delayed - we are told because pilots coming in on another flight. Wait hours. We board - lights dimmed - flight attendants continue to get on the announcements - pilots have landed - headed to our plane. 10 minutes later - pilots have decided to deadhead - everyone off. We go to the desk - computer says weather. NO compensation. Emailed American - they proceed to tell me how weather works. I UNDERSTAND that we can't control weather. What you can control is LYING. Every other plane took off. Our pilots were LATE and didn't want to continue. It was STAFF - not weather. To make matters worse - we weren't allowed to get our bags. They were locked. We were stuck overnight - no compensation - no bags - nothing. I flew Alaska - the next day. Never again.
946,✅ Trip Verified |  We were on flight into Dallas then on to Nashville. Storms were present so we have red for an hour then diverted to Houston for refueling. So we missed our connecting float and arrived back at Dallas at midnight. Everyone has to stand in line to rebook and wait time on phone is 2-3 hours. So at 12:30am. They close all customer service desks even with at least 100 people in line. Dallas airport has zero options for food or drink at this time except vending machines that work some of the time. So they book us on a 9 PM flight tonight. So we book another flight thru another airline but you can’t get your baggage until security comes in at 3am. If I could do negative rating I would. I will say the crew on the plane was friendly.
947,"Not Verified | I'm really disappointed about my experience I went to the counter to ask a question about the free check bag and guess what this lady took my bag and said that I have to check my bag because the flight was full I refused and forced me to do it. I think this is unfair when I completely optional, took me more time to get my bag at the belt and I almost missed my flight. I haven't flight with America in long time and I will never do it again"
948,"✅ Trip Verified |  What a joke American Airlines has become. Don't bother paying for a First class ticket because the only thing it gets you is a bigger seat. The service is such a disappointment. I traveled from RDU to CLT for the first part of my trip and during the flight at NO time did the two lead flight attendants offer anything to the first class cabin. Instead they sat up front the whole flight and chatted. They also brought full bottles of water to airline personnel that were traveling in the coach section who were non-reviving and heading home. Then they had the gall to walk through the cabin and ask for garbage because they would be to lazy to clean the plane at the end of the trip. The discussion in frost class then became the lack of customer service that was happening. I tried asking the gate agent the name of the flight attendants when i deplaned but she refused to give them to me and told me to contact customer service. Please read the generate and canned response from American airlines. This airline has become the joke in the aviation industry. The to top it off they want you to review the customer service agent begging for good reviews. [email protected] October 23, 2022 Hello Ms. xxxxx: Thank you for contacting American Airlines.

949,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Horrible airline. Customer Service people at the gate were rude and condescending. I only had a small carry on and small luggage. Made me check my bag. Even though it fit into their check bag display. I don't care if it was for free I wanted to keep my bag with me th3 reason why I brought it. Of course you can't refuse because that causes a whole other cascade of events. They even went to go so far as to say they will run out of gas. Really that's what you tell passengers who are about to fly. Run out of gas from Chicago to New York. What are you flying on 1/4 gas tank or something. I'm upset my tax dollars bailed them out. I never fly them because they have a history of being rude. The only reason why I went with them this time because it was less that 300 dollars for a round trip. flight from Sfo to NY. Would I fly them again for the same price, maybe, but only of it is extremely cheap. If its market rate. I rather pick Southwest at least their nice or Delta."
950,"Not Verified |  This was the only time I’ve flown with American Airlines and it will be my last. Each flight to and from my destination they delayed our flight until a day. They were not helpful at all for helping switch and change my flight, which was there fault. The staff was rude beyond belief. One of the ladies made me check my carry on when I’ve never had a problem with it. And have always made it through every airport and flight with it. I’m sitting in my seat right now just livid. I’ll never fly American again. It was the most stressful and awful flights I’ve ever experienced"
951,"✅ Trip Verified |  Plane had not taken off yet, was set to depart at 4:32pm. I arrived at 4:12pm and the lady at the gate said sorry gate is closed and allow 3 stand by passengers to go In front of me. It’s not now 4:35pm and I have already walked down by B28 and received a new ticket to depart at 8:08PM. Last time flying American. Terrible service. Always go Delta!"
952,"Not Verified |  American Airlines has been disappointing in every capacity during this trip. We were 2 minutes late and missed our connecting flight, their customer service is a sorry excuse as a representative of their airline. When addressing concerns their staff was aggressive and unsympathetic to the point I will refuse to fly this airline in the future. This was supposed to be the vacation of a lifetime not an obstacle course from hell to get home!"
953,"Not Verified |  Trip was delayed then canceled then rescheduled but too late for anyone to make connections. Employees were short, insensitive and rude. I lost my family weekend vacation to the Canyon. Such an awful experience. Glad the rest of the family flew Spirit. They made it just fine. "
954,"✅ Trip Verified |  Another good experience on American. This 10 hour flight was very comfortable and I was happy with all the elements. Flagship lounge was great, food was quite good and the service was efficient and very friendly. Only complaint is the entertainment system which had plenty of content but awkward to use with many unresponsive moments. All in all, in my experiences these last two flights, American is upping their premium game."
955,✅ Trip Verified |  What a surprisingly first rate experience. On a red eye out of Hawaii I’ve become used to a grumpy attendant serving a snack. On this flight a charming hard working woman served a delicious full meal followed by an ice cream sundae! The seat was ok for 5 hours although the no screen aspect isn’t terrific. There is nothing to add except to say that American may just be upping their game. Impressive!
956,"✅ Trip Verified |  I purchased tickets through Priceline. I was flying from Albuquerque to Spokane and had a layover in Phoenix. For the carry on they don’t let you use duffle bags. They don’t tell you that on the website. The flight was fairly short so they didn’t offer beverages but they did provide beverages upon request. I was requesting water and coffee so I can’t speak on that plane’s beverage selection, I remember seeing someone requesting Trulys. The second flight was about 2hrs and they were pretty consistent about offering snacks and beverages. They had a nice selection of beverages for being a plane. The only thing that cost money was the adult beverages. I will admit when it comes to beverage selection my expectations aren’t high for planes, coffee and water. They had coffee, water, a couple sodas, and adult beverages. Both planes were comfortable for being planes mind you I’m a ~190lbs woman with medium build. Overall it was a good experience and I’d fly with them again."
957,"Not Verified |  Terrible! Was on connecting flights, both were delayed. Took 9 hours to get from JFK to IAH airport. On way home, took 7 hours. Couldn't get my carry on bag on because ""compartments"" were crowded. Had to walk over 20 minutes to baggage claim and then wait 15 minutes for baggage to arrive."
958,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have a couple of major issues with AA after today’s flights. Firstly, carry on. My assigned grouping prevented me from boarding until 90% of passengers were already on the plane. When I could finally board, AA staff told that there was no space in the cabin for any more carry on items and that my single item (which met their carry on requirements) would have to be checked in. I replied that this was the first leg of a long journey to Australia and I needed access to my carry on. They literally said there was nothing they could do about that and that I would be bumped from the flight if I refused to check it in. They also said the door was closing soon so I had to decide immediately. I feel that this created an element of duress that was at a minimum unethical. I also think that their attitude to customers is appalling considering that these situation are 100% AA’s fault - their carry on requirements don’t align with the capacity of their own aircraft. When I finally received my suitcase back from them in Sydney, I found that they had somehow completely destroyed it (see attached photo). Secondly, the flight took off from DC at 5:15pm and landed in LA at 11pm (DC time). Who wouldn’t want to eat dinner at some point during these hours? Nevertheless, the only food they offered was a small packet of either cookies (for other Australians, this translates to “2 small biscuits) or pretzels. I couldn’t even pay them for real food - they just had nothing. I wouldn’t treat a dog like AA treats their customers."
959,"✅ Trip Verified | My non-stop window seat flight was cancelled. American Airlines could not accommodate me with a flight until the next day. No compensation for a 2 hour trip to and from the airport, or hotel or food. I had a nonstop flight with a window seat. American got me on the next day with a layover and a middle seat with no wi-fi so no entertainment. Customer service said they got me from point A to point B but not I what I paid for! I received 7500 miles which gives me nothing! Customer service said they filled their role by getting me a flight. They don’t care."
960,"✅ Trip Verified | After being shunted onto a Charlotte flight (see previous review of London - Philadelphia) had a much better experience. Got 2 seats together on a flight about an hour later than our original. To my surprise they were the most comfortable Premium Economy seats I have ever flown in. Reasonably helpful F/A's although their slightly offhand attitude when only ""shrimp"" meals were left was a bit off putting. We eventually got a Pasta dish. Generous with the wine servings. Good selection of in flight entertainment with noise reducing headphones. Flight took off and landed on time. Baggage off reasonably quickly at a quiet Charlotte airport. If all AA flights are like this I could recommend."
961,"✅ Trip Verified | This is an example of shocking behaviour by AA. Never flown with them before we decided to change from BA to Miami and up to Charleston because Hurricane Ian was imminent. Changed to AA London - Philadelphia with the intention of staying 1 or 2 nights in an airport hotel (my wife had been to Philly before and we could at least explore until we could travel on) until we could fly to Charleston and then travel on to Hilton Head Island. Checked in online, and printed Boarding passes. Left home at 2am as it was an early flight. Got to Heathrow T3 only to be told we had been bumped off of the flight, and were now travelling the next day (and not even in P/Economy - which we had paid for). No reason except ""it's the weather"". Yes - we know. That's why we changed to go to Philly. We now had to see the Agent and got a flight in P/E to Charlotte - right into the path of the hurricane. Stayed in a Hotel for 2 days that we couldn't leave because of ""the weather"" - no restaurant and no bar for night 2. A very bad experience for our first encounter with AA. See next review for the replacement flight to Charlotte."
962,"✅ Trip Verified |  Lady checking us in was rude. She made me check my bag because it wouldn’t fit, but didn’t let me get my medicine or wallet out of it. Also my bag totally would have fit it was the same one I had on the way to Knoxville. Very annoying. When I asked them please not to lose my bag she said “pack a smaller one next time”"
963,"✅ Trip Verified | My husband and I were on flight AA1400 out of Miami today. We were attempting to get to our honeymoon destination in Jamaica. We boarded the flight around 12:10 PM with an expected take off at 12:56 PM. There was light rain that turned into thunderstorms for the first hour of us waiting to take off, delaying our flight. After the first hour it went back to light rain and we noticed several airplanes starting to take off on the runway. After waiting for another hour with minimal updates from the pilot, we were instructed to exit the aircraft. We did as we were told and went to the gate to wait for further instructions. We were informed after about 45 mins minutes that another pilot will be taking over and we were able to re-board the aircraft. The time at re-boarding was approximately 4:30. After another hour of waiting on the now second pilot to take us to our destination, the plane suddenly turned around on the ramp when we were very close to take-off. The plane was taken back to the terminal and all of us passengers were waiting to hear what the delay was this time. Unfortunately for us, there was little communication as to why we could not depart for our destination now 5 hours after our SCHEDULED departure time. I would like to say there was a “vague” explanation but I simply cannot. Even their pilot could not explain why he was not allowed to take us where we paid good money to be. It was at this time we were instructed to de-board the plane a SECOND time. After some talk amongst the flight crew and I suppose them communicating with their outside resources, they informed us of a THIRD pilot who would be boarding and be responsible for taking us to our destination. We FINALLY were able to depart at exactly 7:06PM. We had been on that plane for 7 hours today, just sitting and waiting and left in the dark. The flight crew kindly passed around cookies and one cup of water during our first delay around approximately 2:30. When asked to de-board there was no time for any passengers to stop and eat because we were trying to stay close to be informed on the situation only to re-board and wait an additional 3 hours. There were several small children on this flight as well. AA should be extremely disappointed in how this situation was handled. It was unprofessional and cruel to leave us waiting and waste our time. My husband and I missed our first day at our expensive resort on our first day of our honeymoon. They left children and other passengers crying and hungry. Shame on them. I am not one to leave a bad review or even write an email to this extent (especially on my honeymoon) but given the situation it is much deserved. We tried on our honeymoon to call and get compensation and all we received were two $50 trip vouchers. We will NEVER fly AA again and neither should you. They lack care for their customers and accountability. They make it hard to file a complaint because I am sure they get too many. Do yourself a favor and fly Delta."
964,✅ Trip Verified |  Very good experience. Nice people and what a aircraft! Had a 14 hour fight but enjoyed every moment of it. The plane was nice and modern - thank you American Airlines
965,Not Verified | I'll start by saying I fly Delta for a reason. We are in the plane and ready to take off and the bathrooms don't work. They tell us it will take 30 minutes to complete the paperwork but hold your bladder. So we started watching a movie. And they decided to push commercials on the screen as we sat in the plan. Next was the credit card push with a 10 minute announcement. I'm sorry but I'll take an extra stop on Delta than deal with this mickey mouse company
966,✅ Trip Verified | Cancun to Nashville via Charlotte. Worst airline ever to be so expensive. Flight was delayed so we missed our connection. American Airlines didn’t do anything to accommodate this situation and we have been given the complete run around. I will never use them again .
967,"Not Verified | I have been a loyal American Airlines passenger since 2007. I flew with them for both business travel and my personal travel. In the last 2 years or so, their customer service has plummeted. My final straw was this morning when, to not fault of AA, I missed my flight by one minute because of a delay in the Queens Tunnel and the TSA baggage screening system breaking down and chaos happening. However, their gate agent, was one of the most unhelpful, rude and downright hateful persons I have ever met. This is the third time in a row I have had to email a complaint because AA employees treat their passengers like garbage. I carry their credit card, I'm usually a Platinum or higher flyer and I currently have over 500,000 miles to show for my loyalty. I am now going to switch to Delta, where I have no status, because I will no longer give my money to a company that treats their passengers the way American does time and time again. I suggest anyone reading this do the same."
968,✅ Trip Verified | This is the second time in two months they have canceled my flight on the day of departure. Spirit is even better than this. I will never use this airline again.
969,✅ Trip Verified |  I'm a disabled veteran and was told twice that I would receive a refund. They decided to give me a flight credit and will not refund my ticket even though I canceled within 24 hours. 
970,"✅ Trip Verified | Ironically, American was EARLY on all of their flights, which alleviated a huge worry because of all the horror stories I've heard. The staff were friendly enough and basic services were offered (even on an extremely short flight), but my biggest issue was just how uncomfortable American's planes are. I'm 6'2"" and legroom ranged from acceptable, to downright awful. The seats themselves were simply some of the most uncomfortable I've ever experienced. I know the CRJ Series is not known for its comfort, but I've flown Delta's version, and it was far more comfortable than American's product. Also, the in-flight entertainment was clunky and straight-up didn't work on one of my flights. So in short, American got me where I needed to go on time, but the level of discomfort makes me hesitant to ever fly them again, especially if it is a longer flight."
971,"✅ Trip Verified | I did not choose American - I know they are awful. It was attached to my Alaska Airlines flight. I had requested wheelchair assistance - it all went off without a hitch flying into Dallas - however there was a chair with no person to move said chair. And I’m being asked to produce a ticket I don't have - I get a little louder and say “I do not have a ticket I need it printed at the Alaska gate”, the awful gate staff member starts on me - meanwhile the only person who comprehends the fact that I’m not flying American, they are just a filler airline is also being dismissed by staff member! It’s bad enough to fly when you are in pain, but to be demeaned by an ignorant member of staff is horrible! "
972,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have flown with American Airlines before and have never had a problem until this last time I flew. My mother paid for my ticket - it was a birthday gift and a month before I was to fly out they changed the times. No big deal but when they've done this in the past they changed them back they did not change the times back as they always did and when my mother called to ask them why they were not changing the times back to the original time the gentleman informed her it was $800 to change the times back but American Airlines are the ones that changed the times to begin with so why would you charge someone $800 to get those times back. I then get to the airport the lady asked me if I had any check-in bags or just a carry-on bag I have a little carry-on bag and another little case I asked her very clearly if I needed to have the carry-on bag checked in she said no they both can be considered a carry-on so I go to my gate as I'm getting ready to board the plane the lady informs me I cannot have a carry-on, my little case and my purse I informed her that the woman downstairs said it was okay this woman wanted to charge me $2,700 to have my carry-on, my little case and my purse I have never in my life heard of something so ridiculous I of course did not pay that kind of money I don't have that kind of money I told her I've never had an issue why this is becoming an issue now is beyond me and to want somebody to pay for a bag to carry on the plane is ridiculous. I don't think I will be flying with you guys ever again."
973,"✅ Trip Verified | American Airlines cancelled my flight, due to not having enough flight attendants and then shipped my bag to the wrong place. I had to pay for a hotel, and was never reimbursed because their voucher machine was not working at the time. I never received my bag after filing two claims, and was never refunded for almost $3000 worth of snowboarding gear and clothes. They made me go through a whole process of filling out every item I had in the bag along with receipts of every item over $100 dollars and expected me to complete it within weeks of receiving the form, as if that is all I have to spend my time on. They would not even look for the bag until I completed the form. Overall a terrible experience and I am hesitant to ever fly American again if this is how they treat their customers."
974,"Not Verified | Phoenix to Monterey. American Airlines is the worst to fly. They are #1 one of the most expensive airlines, #2 their staff aren’t the greatest and #3 their online customer service is absolutely horrible! All this airline cares is about money and do not care about their customers what’s so ever. I will never waste my time or money with this airline ever again. Thanks for nothing."
975,"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight crews were fine, but the online and phone customer service was awful. Had flights canceled and rebooked 4 different times, then was charged a total of 200 bucks for bags and also to be able to sit with my wife. One of the rebookings actually had me originating in Rochester, Minnesota, rather than NY ... ridiculous!  Then we end up taking 11 hours to get home with 2 stops instead of 7 hours and 1 stop. We will never fly American again"
976,"✅ Trip Verified |  In March 2020, we were planning a tour of Ireland and then going on to Scotland via American Airlines. Suitcases were packed and we were flying out with our daughter from Wyoming and meeting our son from Colorado in Ireland, a trip of a lifetime. Then, Covid hit and our trip was postponed. We were disappointed, but made a new plan for 2022. Our travel agent was able to rebook our tickets and we thought we were set. However, covid prevailed and our tour company again made the decision to wait. So here it is time to get tickets for 2023 and that is where we hit a huge snag. American Airlines refused to book us a ticket for 2023. We were told that tickets must be issued by September 30th and must be used by December 31st, 2022, no exceptions. Since our tour is April of 2023, it is not a plausible plan for us. We have tried to talk to American Airlines, but they say policy is policy. That is fine, but give us our money back. How can American Airlines just keep over $4000 of our money because of policy for no service rendered? Our son is the lucky one, he booked with United Airlines. No problem, they are happy to accommodate. We, however, have hit closed doors and feel cheated and mystified by American Airlines. My advice to everyone, do not fly American Airlines. They cause only disappointment and stress."
977,"Not Verified | Just got back from Brazil. We flew American Airlines both ways. We had a total of 18 flights there and back. Everything was good until we went to board in Miami. Before we even boarded the gate attendant was talking to a drunk guy saying “now we aren’t going to have anymore problems with you are we?” And the gate attendant held out his hand for the drunk guy to shake it and the drunk guy wouldn’t shake it. They still let the drunk guy board the plane. As we are in position to take off the flight attendant came over the PA telling him to sit down we are taking off. He did sit down but they still had several problems with him. So when we get 1 hour out from Miami they turn the plane around, without saying anything to us until we are just outside Miami. Than when we landed we landed to hard and broke the landing gear. We hit HARD. Security came and got the drunk guy off the plane and we are told that we just had to refuel than we would take off. After 1/2 hour they said that we had to take our stuff and get off the plane. We waiting in the airport for over 2 hrs and there where mothers with multiple babies and they would not get those women their strollers so they had to hold their babies the whole time and there was 1 lady with 4 babies under 6 months. Than after 3 hours they tell us they are rescheduling our flight for the next day and we couldn’t get our luggage. So hopefully you packed some clothes in your carry on, which we had. We finally got in our hotel room at 3am. We had not had anything to eat since our last flight at like 4pm. We where starving and nothing was open. The next day we did take off around 1pm but we ended up missing a whole day of our trip. It messed up our hotel, rental car. We did file a complaint with AA. They offered My husband $50 total for our inconvenience. My husband emailed them back and said he was insulted. So they ended up giving us $175 per person of AA credit. Who says we will ever fly with them again. They can shove that. We will never and I repeat NEVER fly with them again. Plus the food was horrible. We will pay extra to fly another airline. If your going to fly you might want to pay extra for a different airline, it will be worth it. They should have never let the drunk guy on the flight, they knew he was trouble. However AA doesn’t care. My husband was told well you got to your destination didn’t you. Yup we did the next day, we ended up in flight the whole day instead of being at the beach. Thanks for nothing AA!"
978,"Not Verified | RNO-DFW. Pleasantly surprised after seeing all the reviews. Easy check-in and luggage checked through to final destination of London with British Airways. Luggage arrived safely in London with no issue. Ground staff and cabin crew were fine. On time departure and arrival in Dallas. Easy transfer over to British Airways after AA flight. Pre-selected no fee seats were honored. Beverages were served. It was nice to receive a full can of soda and not just a cup full. The 2.5 hour flight passed quickly. No fuss, no drama. Well done. I'll just take off one point here because of the hard landing in Dallas."
979,Not Verified | Austin to Boston. They are very rude and insensibly annoying. They made me to check-in my carryon at the gate because they said there is no space in the plane. When I got to the plane there were plenty of space that I could use for my carry-on. So they lie too. Also when you check-in your carryon at the gate instead giving you the carryon at the arrival gate they send it to luggage claim so basically your carry-on is destroyed and ruined. I hate this airline
980,"✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to London. Really bad service. This was a code share with British Airways which I booked on the same ticket and flew British Airways on the way out. BA allowed me to check a bag and choose a seat for my flight once I checked in without issue. AA failed to let me check my bag or choose a seat at all, although they admitted that it made no sense that my ticket had allowed me to check my bag in on the way to the USA. They were unwilling to do anything to help. I was particularly disgusted with the behaviour the call centre staff who was not only extremely unhelpful and left me in a distressing and disgraceful situation, but proceeded to laugh at my predicament twice during our call which was very disrespectful. Her manager was completely useless. They convey being a credible airline but in fact worse than Ryanair who at least acknowledge that they are a bargain basement airline. AA are not fit to be transatlantic carriers. On board, the service was far poorer than BA. It has tighter seating, shorter seatbelts (unsuitable if you are a bit overweight) & the entire flight was extremely cold with the stewards switching the aircon back on because they were hot despite the fact that our entire row was freezing & covered in jumpers and blankets to try and keep off the cold. I would seriously avoid this airline going forward if I can."
981,"Not Verified | This was a final leg of our trip back home. We had traveled from Orlando to LA, LA to Maui. During our trip we traveled from Maui to Oahu back to Maui. Then then I'll return trip We went from Maui to LAX. During all parts of our trip, our entire family traveled with only carry-on bags and never had any issues until at LAX when a gate attendant decided to single us out and decide that one of our bags was too large. When I attempted to address the issue with him, he was overtly rude and dismissive and literally shoot me away with his hand to go away. I attempted to address my concerns with the airline and was met with a boiler plate cut and paste response."
982,Not Verified | Some times people just make a review to complain about a situation but I am writing this review to give kudos to an amazing selfless flight attendant who went out of her way to help me. I know she went out of her way because she mentioned that she was in a hurry to get to the other side of the airport to her assigned gate. That speaks volumes that she took the time to help me. I would have been stuck at the airport all night possibly all weekend if it wasn't for her willingness to help me and find me another flight. I waited over 12 hours at the airport. With no guidance or help my flight continued to get delayed. I finally had enough of sitting at the airport and not being able to get to my dentation which was originally Washington DC. I went to a very helpful and kind flight attendant explained to her that I am in desperate need of getting as closet to Richmond VA as possible she found a resolution rerouting my flight to Raleigh NC.
983,"Not Verified | Cancun to Dallas via Cleveland. If I could give negative stars, I would. The only saving grace this airline has is their flight attendants. Their customer service is rude and disrespectful. They don't care about their customers in any way. They don't give notice when they drop you. We nearly didn't make it home from our trip to Mexico because they just pushed us out another day. They say that you are entitled to a refund when this happens, but now they've only given us a $50 flight voucher that amounts to absolutely nothing. They are not following their policy and putting my wife and I through hell. Frankly, I had better experiences flying Frontier and Spirit than I did American. Save your money and avoid American at all costs, because they'll make sure you waste your money."
984,"Not Verified |  Flew with American Airlines to Orlando for a family funeral, flight was cancelled due to hurricane but the airline got me on the next flight, staff and flight was great, meals were good. On return I had to extend my flight date and the airline and customer service were fantastic, very helpful and didn’t even charge me due to family loss. Definitely recommend them for their great service. Thank you to all staff who helped me."
985,"Not Verified |  I fly first class with American Airlines at a minimum once a month and or pay for my Chief Operations Officer to fly first class. I politely asked the Stewardess to turn the air down because I was hot and I heard coach passengers requesting for the air to be turned up. I’ve never complained once before but if I’m paying for first class my request should be treated with respect. This flight attendant is less than 100lbs and I understand but it’s a 6 hour flight. Lastly, when boarding the plane only one entrance way was open so it didn’t matter if you purchased first class or not."
986,"Not Verified |  Chicago to Phoenix. American Airlines is embarrassing. One minute before boarding was scheduled to start last night, one minute, the counter representatives announced a delay “due to a missing Captain.” I went to the counter to share that the reason for the delay offered was a joke, not true and not transparent. Both counter personnel acknowledged I was correct, the Captain was reassigned to another flight at the last minute. Then, 20 minutes later, the flight was cancelled. We were forced to stay overnight in a hotel. The next day the flight was scheduled for 9:00 AM, then delayed to noon and now it was pushed to 3:00 PM. This is a joke. Laughable. Embarrassing."
987,"Not Verified |  The worst customer service and flight experience since I started flying 50 years ago. Delayed flights, mechanical issues, diverted flights with zero attempts to re-book or have our connection wait 20 minutes for us. They could not care less whether we ever made our final leg to St. Thomas USVI. Fly any other airline."
988,"Not Verified |  They have an app but it is sub par. Didn't update gate changes, causing me to miss my connection. I haven't been home in a month, but thanks to AA, that'll be a month and a day. I never had this problem with Delta (my preferred airline). AA is cheaper, but I can see clearly, it's for obvious reasons."
989,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarded the planes. The first leg left on time, second a little delayed bit wound up around 10 minutes late. Crew was nice, but nothing memorable. Connected in Dallas, which seems to have smooth operations. The American App was not working so we had to get paper boarding passes. Come on, American, you're not Spirit! There was a power outlet, a type of USB port I believe was to plug your phone charger in, though I may be wrong, nonetheless, a port and outlet. The flight to CLE from DFW was on time which was nice. Unfortunately, though my first impression with American was in 2016 which was when A320 or A321 fleet had free entertainment and seatback screens which I hear they are in the process of removing in favor of streaming. Overall, both flights were nice and smooth, i'd take them over Spirit or Frontier any day if close in price, but i'll stick to United for now. Why? Because unlike American, United has reversed course and has decided to bring seatback entertainment with a personal tv on every seat on their whole fleet by 2025. If American continues their current path, they will be the only Legacy Carrier without seatback entertainment, and we will fly them only if they are significantly cheaper than their competitors, Delta and United, as they were when we booked this flight. One aspect i'd like to give American credit for, were the gate agents helping us out at CLE Airpot. As a United frequent flyer, the friendly agents reminded me of the good old days of Continental. Maybe we just got lucky, but the team at the check in counter was super nice, which was a pleasant surprise for a 5:45 AM flight!"
990,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had 3 flight credits for myself and my kids due to my flight being cancelled and originally had main cabin tickets. When re-booking I was told I could not use the credits to book a basic economy flights, however they could not direct me to the terms and conditions were it stated that information. I tried getting assistance from their online customer service and I was told to call Customer Service. After speaking with 3 reps and 1 supervisor (all very rude and not willing to help), I was stuck having to pay another $400 more so that these credits did not cancel. The supervisor I spoke to from Dallas was extremely defensive, would not let me finish and when I got transferred again to online web support she refused to give me her name and disconnected the call."
991,"Not Verified | I had booked my reservation and picked my seats (I upgraded) months in advance. 6 hours before the flight left, I was automatically switched to a different flight ( much earlier than my original) due to now missing my connection. I spent 4 hours on hold with American Airlines for them not to help me and told me I had to get my seat assignment once I was at the gate. I was assigned a seat on the flight however it is a middle seat in economy. I am highly disappointed with American Airlines - this is my first and probably last time flying with them."
992,"✅ Trip Verified |  First and foremost the last thing I want to be worrying about after what we just experienced is dealing or worrying about plane tickets, but right now every penny is crucial. We were in the cross way of hurricane Ian, fort myers. House gone and we were supposed to have a flight in one week, clearly, we knew that wasn’t Happening and although didn’t want to worry about it, knew we needed it cancelled and our money returned. Every single person I spoke with were so inconsiderate, lack of compassion and had the nerve to state “I understand your concern” in the mist of telling me, there is nothing they can do but Give me a new date rather than refund. The last person, manager on duty, I spoke with telling me there was no other person above him I could speak too and nothing he can do as far as refund. For a natural disaster American Airlines has No sympathy and no intend of making things right to help their customers. Fair warning to all, do not book. With Delta, we didn’t even need an explanation they heard we were affected and refunded us immediately. I am sick that what we just experienced, what we lost, still they wanted to argue and not give me a refund."
993,"✅ Trip Verified |  The aircraft was clean. Both departure and arrival were only 20 minutes late and the business class seats were very comfortable, including a larger than usual footwell which was wonderful. However, the cabin was severely understaffed and the cabin crew gave the impression of being annoyed at serving passengers. As with my JFK-ATH flight several weeks earlier the food served was close to inedible. On both flights AA offered a single appetizer of shrimp ... for anyone with allergies to shrimp or religious problems with said shrimp - tough luck. Further to meal service, drinks were served only once, no coffee or tea was ever offered. My Inflight entertainment did not function except for the first hour of the flight. Ninety minutes prior to landing we were told to expect severe turbulence for the next 45 minutes and thus no second meal service. There was not a single bit of turbulence nor a second meal service. We considered this to be deliberate. A very comfortable seat was the only positive of this flight. Everything else was the worst I've experienced in 40 years of flying."
994,"✅ Trip Verified |  It’s not often that customers take the time and effort to review an airline. I travel frequently to Florida and also to Europe using American Airlines because I am a credit card holder and I appreciate the free baggage allowance as well as zone 5 priority boarding. I always need to save money so I fly Basic Economy. I want to say that my June, July experiences post-pandemic were very uncomfortable with long delays and almost missed flight. But my experiences since July 2022 have been absolutely stellar. I have been impressed and grateful to be flying AA again. Specifically, the customer service people Sharon and Kim in Wilmington NC on September 13 and Francisco on September 20 in West Palm Beach FL were, to a person, above and beyond in customer service. Sharon was wonderful at helping me sort out how to fly standby on an earlier flight. She helped Kim learn how to properly tag a checked bag when the traveler is on Standby. Instead of brushing me aside they were capable, calm, smiling, and gracious to me and to other travelers in line. Everything went smoothly as grace. So many other people greeted me with friendly smiles, good eye contact, patience and kindness (when I bugged them to ask if I’d made the cut to Standby seat). I was very impressed with the informative way in CLT that the gate agent for gently but firmly handling another inebriated male passenger and for juggling everyone with kindness, patience and aplomb. He informed us of the status of a fuel tank that needed to be topped off, and quickly and smoothly got us all boarded. No one works alone but I wanted to take the time to mention some of them by name. I’m again proud to fly “American”."
995,"✅ Trip Verified |  There is absolutely no reason why in 2022 a customer can't get a full refund with sufficient notice of a cancelation. Its September 29 and my trip was for Feb 28th 2023. My dog needs a $12,000 surgery. This wasn't planned for obviously. Neither airline was understanding. I understand it says no refunds as soon as you book but honestly the airlines are just money hungry. Life happens. Help the people out. Like I said, with sufficient time, we all deserve a full refund. It's not like I canceled a day before and expect it."
996,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the absolute worst experience I have ever had flying. Rude staff, not on time, and wasted my entire day at the airport. Our initial flight was supposed to leave sometime around 10. We got to the airport around 8 to check in and immediately our flight was delayed by 3 hours. The next soonest flight was not until 4 and we were unable to make it to our destination until 9. We spent 11 and a half hours at the airport doing absolutely nothing because we can’t afford the airport food. Absolutely unacceptable. Then on the way home same issue. We got on our plane to leave and ended up sitting for an hour waiting for it to take off causing us to miss our connection and be unable to get on another plane until 9 o clock. Every time I attempted to get help or assistance from staff they were rude and on top of that I was not given the free food vouchers I was promised for a flight delayed beyond 3 hours. Thanks for ruining our entire vacation. Never again will I fly American Airlines."
997,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew full-fare first class with my wife. Flight attendant was in a bad mood when we boarded. in my opinion she was surly and unfriendly. I asked for ear buds, the cheap disposable type that were distributed to us a week earlier in the American Airlines flight into Jackson Hole. She told us she had none. End of discussion; no apology or recognition that we would be on a three-hour flight and not be able to use the in-flight entertainment system. In effect, we were denied use of a much advertised service and one for which we had paid top dollar. To add insult to injury, she suggested we use our layover time in Chicago to obtain ear buds on our own. I submitted a complaint for to American Customer Service. Their response was most disappointing. They stated they try to train their air crews to be courteous, and that ear buds are not guaranteed in first class - not guaranteed! They stated there was nothing they could do for me- no compensation and no mention of correcting the rude attendant. Other aspects of the flight were equally disappointing. The meal service consisted of a cold turkey sandwich on a cold chewy roll. The gentleman seated in front of me reclined into my lap. My seat was against a bulkhead, so I could not recline to give myself breathing room. So much for the luxury of first class travel. All in all, a very disappointing flight and even more disappointing interaction with American Airlines Customer Service."
998,"✅ Trip Verified |  A few minutes after exiting my plane in DFW, I received a gate change from terminal C way over to A. By this time, the gate attendants were gone. I rushed along the route and was finally able to snag a transit cart but did not make my connection. The cart dropped me at customer service where there was a line, including a man in a wheelchair and his relative who were in the same sinking boat as me. Since my arrival flight arrived a couple of minutes early, I was not given a hotel room. I was booked on the next flight to my destination which would not take off for 24-hrs. My destination was Connecticut, not some tiny, out-of-the-way airport. I asked and was told my checked bag would be waiting at BDL. 24 hours later, I finally made it to BDL but baggage customer service did not have my bag. The gentleman was very kind and tried to be helpful. My bag info had been switched with another passenger and apparently, my bag was back in DFW. By this time, a line of people at least 15 people long was in line for missing luggage. 15! This morning, I received a call from a very nice stranger. My suitcase had just been delivered to his house from AA in BDL. He was kind enough to drive it over to me before heading to BDL to figure out where his luggage was. My suitcase also has damage from the trip. Also, no Wi-Fi on any of my flights! Never will I use American Airlines or travel thru DFW!!!"
999,"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and I tried to checkin online. We were unable to because American Airlines said we had to use VeriFLY. That cost $15. Otherwise we would need to go to the ticket counter at the airport. Please understand we have already paid for TSA and GloBal Entry. While we paid the additional $15 for VeriFLY and did not have to use the downstairs ticket counter at the Philadelphia Airport, we did need Togo to the upstairs ticket counter at our gate to obtain a paper ticket prior to boarding. They are doing whatever they need to do to rip off the customer, while making their life easier. It’s all a scam to collect as much money as possible from their customers."
